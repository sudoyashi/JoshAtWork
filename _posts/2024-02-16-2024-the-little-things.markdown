## Twenty-somethings are still figuring it out

Ahh yes, the twenties. Some people peaked in high school. But this time it's the late bloomer's turn. Sprinkled with bullshit, irreplaceable memories, and sometimes unbelievable things that you have or haven't done that no one is going to believe your stories. It all sounds too familiar.

In many ways, it parallels a lot of what I've felt in middle school, with a little more freedom. It's a transition period from adulthood to parenthood. For others, it's a time to enjoy ourselves with newfound money, accolades, glory, and accomplishments that we've never had before. However, some adults still can't do middle school math, so not everything has changed. Every year could be an identity crisis, and yeah, that still happens lol.

- Buy that Grand Seiko
- Buy those limited edition wheels
- Get in on the official Supreme drop
- Just buy a Supra
- Let's fly to Korea

It's all possible now! Frankly, I am happier in my life because I have the privilege to do and have all of these things that lil me would have been stoked to have had five years earlier. But I remember the first time getting a watch that I thought I really wanted, I bought it and got it in the mail and I definitely liked it, but it didn't make me feel like I have more, all it meant was that I had a new shiny watch. It didn't change my life and I think I knew it wouldn't but that experience wasn't what I was looking for.

If I got those new boots or got that new watch, then I'll be happy. This time I'll feel better. After each purchase, I felt good about myself. Then, two or three months later, the impact never lasted. I couldn't satisfy that itch and think it's impossible to remain satisfied. It'll get close, but there's always something more. I've started narrowing down my choices on what I want to grind for and what I can ignore. It's a start.

## ITB Manifold and steering rack are coming!

![Maybe we'll add a mono](https://sudoyashi.com/assets/img/2024/cabby/mono-cabby.jpg)

I've been working with a specialist manufacturer in Washington on an ABA manifold, I've see his work with Volkswagens and I really want him to make my manifold. Design was sent and confirmed with him and hopefully we'll be getting the finished product in about a month. On the other side of the states, another gentlemen helped me figure out what manual steering parts I'll need to changeover into a manual rack. The leaks are not worth keeping this thing together. It might be an issue in autocross, but really, I'm not winning in this car anytime soon, haha.

Rebuilding my cabby has always been on the table, but I've come to terms with knowing that this rebuild will be worth my time agonizing over all the little things. I'm all too familiar with the grind from college and it sucks. But, you get what you put in at the end of the day. It's still going to be a shitbox 110HP car, but it's MY shitbox 110HP car.

## I like the little things. Does that make me an old man now?

![Little things](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/2024/little-things.jpg)

I was hanging out with some mutual friends and told them I was 28. They called me old. I called them annoying.
I don't have a cohesive way to put these trivial things together, so here's an unordered list of unimportant things I thought about over the past few months:

- Finding out that other people do the thing where you make a circle with your pointer and thumb to figure out which one is your drink and bread on a dining table.
- Buying flowers before or on Valentine's Day will always be stressful.
- Explaining how a turbo works is difficult, but making sound effects with your mouth helps. It also helps if you have a turbo.
- Older people are good at things you're not because they're retired and have time. But you still suck at a lot of things, bwaha.
- Sewing is stupid and annoying because I'm not good at it and I have a hard time with it.
- I unconsciously try to copy British accents because of all the RuneScape videos I've watched my entire life. Some of my favorite specific words are gutted and rubbish.

## I don't have a new exhaust, but I have travel pictures

Wine is great and is way cheaper than beer.
