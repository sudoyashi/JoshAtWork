## Twenty-somethings are middle Schoolers with money.

Twenties. Sprinkled with bullshit, irreplaceable memories, and sometimes unbelievable things that you have or haven't done that no one is going to believe your stories. Sounds a little too familiar. 

In a lot of ways, it parallels a lot of what I've felt in middle school, with a little bit more freedom. For some, it's a transition period from adulthood to parenthood and for others, it's a time to enjoy ourselves with newfound money, accolade, glory, and accomplishments that we've never had before. Every year could be an identity crisis and I guess that's okay.

Buy that gold chain.
Buy them sick boots.
Get in on the official Supreme drop.
Buy that Corvette.
Let's fly to Japan.

It's possible now! And quite frankly, I am happier in my life because I have the privilege to do and have all of these things that lil me would be stoked to have had 5 years earlier. But what I've come to learn is finally getting the *thing* never, and could never, sate my entire life's desires because I don't think anything can. While the desires remain, my choices on where to go has definitely improve year after year.

I won't have everything in that I want and experiencing that shortfall, I'm always deciding what to let go and what to chase for. I've let go of finding the next car that I want to buy. I've let go of perfecting my hobbies, and I've let go of my self-help craze. It was fitting for a time in my life, but my priorities have changed where I don't need a faster car, I want to be a faster driver. Perfection in a hobby comes with time, so stop hopping to new ones all the time.  And the entire self-help industry has exploded into absurdity that I don't need to optimize every single second of my life because it is absolutely exhausting.

On the flip side, there are things that I absolutely will put my all into! I've come to enjoy food more, both cooking and eating, after traveling to Europe for a couple weeks. Italy, Greece, and Turkey sparked a massive onset of tasting and finding new flavors that I can try on my own.

Rebuilding my the cabby has always been on the table, but I've come to terms knowing that this rebuild will be worth my time agonizing over all the little things. I know the grind to perfection from my art classes and it's not for the weary. At the end of the day, you'll get what you put in. The external validation from family and friends is a good plus, but my pride has waay more weight. It's still going to be a shitbox 110HP car, but it's MY shitbox 110HP car.

The urges and sudden decisions are still there! But I've gotten better controlling them. Usually.

## Hit a record, then get sick. The ups and downs.

In January, I hit my old personal record on deadlift at 315 lbs and that felt pretty dang good. Then I got a fever from exhaustion. A couple weeks ago, I bested some of my friends in an SCCA race by .003ths of a second. Then I found out I need to replace my brakes and rotors. A couple days ago, I finally got a design approved for my intake manifold and parts for steering rack, but now I'm out another $750 for my project antics, on top of fixing my dad's car and other unexpected costs.

This doesn't impact your life at all, obviously.

There's a give and take with everything and as you get older, the consequences hit just a little harder on your life. Pick your battles but stay on good win/loss ratio.



I like the little things, and more so when other people like the little things that you like

I don't have a cohesive way to put these trivial things together, so here's an unordered list of things of things I enjoyed over the past few months:

- Finding out that other people do the thing where you make a circle with your pointer and thumb to figure out which one is your drink on a dining table was a nice little thing to see.
- Buying flowers prior to or on Valentine's Day will always be stressful.
- Trying to explain how a turbo works is really difficult, but making sound effects really helps. It also helps if you have a turbo.
- Old people are good at things you're not because they're retired and have time. But you still suck at a lot of things, bwaha.
- Sewing is not a blood-talent, it'll get better!
- I unconsciously try to copy British accents because of all the RuneScape videos I've watched in my entire life. Some of my favorite specific words include: gutted, rubbish, and cheeky.



## I don't have a lot of things to say, but here's some photos from Europe.

It was dope.
