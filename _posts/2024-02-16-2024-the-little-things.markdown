## Twenty-somethings are still figuring it out.

Ahh yes, the twenties. Some people peaked in high school. But this time it's the late bloomer's turn. Sprinkled with bullshit, irreplaceable memories, and sometimes unbelievable things that you have or haven't done that no one is going to believe your stories. It all sounds too familiar.

In many ways, it parallels a lot of what I've felt in middle school, with a little more freedom. It's a transition period from adulthood to parenthood. For others, it's a time to enjoy ourselves with newfound money, accolades, glory, and accomplishments that we've never had before. However, some adults still can't do middle school math, so not everything has changed. Every year could be an identity crisis, and yeah, that still happens lol.

Buy that new Grand Seiko.
Buy them sick boots.
Get in on the official Supreme drop.
Buy that Supra.
Let's fly to Korea.

It's all possible now! Frankly, I am happier in my life because I have the privilege to do and have all of these things that lil me would have been stoked to have had five years earlier. But I remember the first time getting a watch that I thought I really wanted, I bought it and got it in the mail and I definitely liked it, but it didn't make me feel like I have more, all it meant was that I had a new shiny watch. It didn't change my life and I think I knew it wouldn't but that experience wasn't what I was looking for.

If I got those new boots or got that new watch, then I'll be happy. This time I'll feel better. After each purchase, I felt good about myself. Then, two or three months later, the impact never lasted. I couldn't satisfy that itch and think it's impossible to remain satisfied. It'll get close, but there's always something more. I've started narrowing down my choices on what I want to grind for and what I can ignore. It's a start.

I've started to let go of finding the next car that I want to buy. I've let go of perfecting my hobbies, and I've let go of my self-help craze. It was fitting for a time, but my priorities have changed. I don't need a faster car; I want to be a quicker driver. Perfection in a hobby comes with time, so stop hopping to new ones all the time. And the entire self-help industry has exploded into absurdity that I don't need to optimize every second of my life because all of this wishing for the next best thing gets exhausting. I really don't have time to care about the next coolest notetaking app. It's intellectual masturbation.

## Not a surprise, I also like cooking

On the flip side, there are things that I absolutely will put my all into! After traveling to Europe for a couple of weeks, I've come to enjoy food more, both cooking and eating. Italy, Greece, and Turkey sparked a massive onset of tasting and finding new flavors I could try independently.

## I swear it's going to get fixed, just give me another 6-12 months

Rebuilding my cabby has always been on the table, but I've come to terms with knowing that this rebuild will be worth my time agonizing over all the little things. I know the grind to perfection from my art classes, and it's not for the weary. You'll get what you put in at the end of the day. The external validation from family and friends is a good plus, but my pride has way more weight. It's still going to be a shitbox 110HP car, but it's MY shitbox 110HP car.

The urges and sudden decisions are still there! But I've gotten better at controlling them. Usually, lol.

## Lift double my bodyweight then get a fever.

In January, I hit my old personal record on deadlift at 315 lbs and that felt pretty good! Then I got a fever from exhaustion. A couple of weeks ago, I bested some friends in an SCCA race by .003ths of a second. Then I found out I needed to replace my brakes and rotors. A couple of days ago, I finally got a design approved for my intake manifold and parts for the steering rack, but my dad's truck has been acting up so I've been working to repair his car too. Pretty good 2024, so far.

There's a give and take with everything; but as you age, the consequences hit a little more complicated in your life. Pick your battles, but stay on a good win/loss ratio.

## I like the little things. Does that make me an old man now?

![Little things](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/2024/little-things.jpg)

I was hanging out with some mutual friends and told them I was 28. They called me old. I called them annoying.

I don't have a cohesive way to put these trivial things together, so here's an unordered list of things I enjoyed over the past few months:

- Finding out that other people do the thing where you make a circle with your pointer and thumb to figure out which one is your drink on a dining table was a nice little thing to see.
- Buying flowers before or on Valentine's Day will always be stressful.
- Explaining how a turbo works is difficult, but making sound effects with your mouth helps. It also helps if you have a turbo.
- Older people are good at things you're not because they're retired and have time. But you still suck at a lot of things, bwaha.
- Sewing is not a blood talent; it'll get better!
- I unconsciously try to copy British accents because of all the RuneScape videos I've watched my entire life. Some of my favorite specific words include gutted, rubbish, and cheeky.

## Yeah, I want to go back to Italy. Spain and Switzerland would be cool too.

It was dope.
