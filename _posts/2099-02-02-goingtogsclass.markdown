I love playing DiRT Rally 2 and have watched a ton of rally on-boards to see the massive balls it takes to win those races. I've watched and learned enough that I've picked up how to read and speak out rally pacenotes and found it to be a lot more useful. I tried it out for my first autocross session and it was surprisingly helpful! Here's a quick breakdown on pacenotes. 

Read the following and see if it makes sense!

## But why...

1) I would love to try a rallycross course someday
2) It's way easier to understand the fast and slow parts of the course than drawing a map
