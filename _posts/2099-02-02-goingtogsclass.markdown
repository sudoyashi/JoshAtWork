Rally Notation - (Personally this is what I'm used to, probably won't work if you aren't already primed for rally notes. If this sentence:

> 6 right long narrows 30 into 3 left caution don't cut into 2 right opens...
>
> Possibly noted as:
> 6 -> || > 30 INTO 3 <- !0 INTO 2 -> < ...
DOES NOT equate to driving instructions to you, then skip this.


For future events, I'll try to post some driving notes, both for myself and for reference IF I want to ever simulate a track layout again ahah. I just want to rally :')
