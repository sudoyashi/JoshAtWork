Our 20s is like middle school for adulthood.

In the middle of "figuring out" and sending it, it's a pretty fun time.

Our 20s in America are an awkward time. Like middle school, but for adulthood. It's a collection of weirdos trying to assert their own identity to others and maybe even prove it to themselves. For some, it's a transition period from adulthood to parenthood and for others, it's a time to enjoy ourselves with newfound money, accolade, glory, and accomplishments that we've never had before.

Every year is an identity crisis, but it's all right

I've turned 28 this past month and I like to do a review of what I did over the past year. Regressing away from being a perfectionist, pedantic donkey, and being okay with imperfection and being "good enough" has been a big takeaway for me. I would differentiate this from "settling" because I think settling is lazy. I don't think it's bad, but it's all an opportunity cost. Time is precious and I'm finding I just don't have the time to learn and improve EVERY single little thing that I've become interested in.

In other words, simplify.

Settling should be part of your lifestyle, but it's not a magic bullet. There are things you should try for! Better careers, better relationships, you know, life-long things that matter. But settling on dinner for the night, a rental you couldn't get, the "perfect" condition used car, or something else. What I'm trying to say is, if you care about the people and things you want, don't settle. I've become less satisfied with awards and praise from other people about the things I have and more satisfied with the stuff that I want and enjoy. 

There are a lot of little things, admittedly very dumb, that make me happy and I think the little surprises that I keep to myself, and maybe share that surprise with a few others, are something that keeps me happy. A few of those things are being able to know the conversion of pounds to grams, new shoelaces for all my shitty shoes, or my morning coffee.

I officiated my cousin's wedding this past weekend and it was a big pressure off my shoulders to finally have done it. This was my first time officiating and rightfully nervous, literally shaking in my leather boots. I think going through it, I got that third-person type of feel. The feeling that you know you're doing something but you feel like you're watching yourself do it. Almost an out-of-body experience type of thing, but not totally paranormal. I was doing everything as rehearsed, automatically, and without pauses.

This was something recurring in band performances from high school. All rehearsed and ready to go, but the only difference is there is an audience. I felt like I was watching myself, but also looking at the crowd and their sharpened gaze. But in my high school days, the nerves of the audience got to me at times. I'd stumble on my notes and default to something less risky or not do things at all. During the ceremony, much better! Growing into my late 20s, my confidence has noticeably improved.

Who the fuck cares

I do, and maybe you don't. That's just how the world works. You start to learn that no matter how embarrassing, painful, humiliating, or trying something was for you in the past, there are very few people that will actually remember and recall that event as often as you do. If you can live with your choices, everything is fine.

For example, the amount of time and money I've spent with a girl in college, only to realize that she won't be living in Hawai'i anymore was pretty cringe (retrospectively lol). But I don't regret that anymore. I used to have regrets about why I did it in the first place, but I did it because it was enjoyable for the time. If you did like it and the time that you've spent, there is nothing regretful about that. Other things that I've done in the past have also been stupid decisions, but as the days go by, you realize no one actually gives a damn or remembers at all. You might, but your friends or family will forget. 

We're all forgetful people, in a good way, because that's how the world works. We move on and forget the dumb choices and words we've done or said in the past.

Enjoy now and reflect later

One of the more annoying things among my peers in their 20s is sharing unwarranted advice and wisdom. Myself included. We haven't lived through enough to actually share proper advice and wisdom that should give principle to others around. 

But Josh, you're doing *exactly* that, why are you trying to act like you're better?

In some ways, I could be better, but in most ways, I'm not. To justify myself,

I think everyone has something to say and most of the time I'd rather listen th
