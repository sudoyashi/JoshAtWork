### Issue: Vapor lock - I want to be alive! Setup for a return line

**Solution: Install a return line.**

![Return line in engine bay with cutter](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/cabby/while-im-in-there/fuelsystem-6.jpg)

I opened up the metal return line with a [tiny metal hose cutter](https://www.homedepot.com/p/RIDGID-1-4-in-to-1-1-8-in-101-Close-Quarters-Copper-Aluminum-Brass-and-Plastic-Tubing-Cutter-Multi-Use-Tubing-Tool-40617/100075014), the Ridgid tool was the perfect tool for the job because it was in such a hard to reach place. Then I used a -6 AN adapter to 5/16" hardline with a -6 AN to 5/16" barb end fitting. 

Initially, I bought a whole $200 AN hose kit to redo my whole fuel system, but later on, I decided to return most of the parts and just used regular fuel hose. AN hose that is NOT PTFE I felt was more money for less return. This isn't a fuel injected car so running the rubber hose would be ok. Carbureted applications don't run much fuel pressure. I'll buy the PTFE hose set if it comes to it. AN lines would be great for other applications, but not for this use case.

Original plan did not work using the WIX 33040 fuel filter. I thought the extra port was a return line, but it's just another outlet and completely destroyed my fuel pressure from 3.7PSI to <1 PSI! I removed it and the car ran okay after. That's what you get for not spending the money on a real regulator. So, I reluctantly spent more money for a proper FPR which will be coming later in August.

In the engine bay, the fuel IN path is:
- Factory hardline with barbed end
- 5/16" fuel hose
- Fuel Pressure regulator, set 3 PSI
- 5/16" fuel hose
- Aeromotive Fuel Pressure Gauge, 1-15 PSI
- 5/16" fuel hose
- Carburetors

The fuel OUT or RETURN path is:
- Fuel Pressure regulator
- 5/16" fuel hose
- 5/16" barb to 6AN adapter to hardline (3 fittings tied together)
- Factory return line

~~The 5/16" barb will connect my return line to my new fuel filter, a [WIX 33040](https://www.amazon.com/WIX-Filters-Complete-Line-Filter/dp/B000C9UJAA). This routes extra fuel/vapors back to my fuel tank. This filter worked for my application because it had 5/16" inlet and outlet ports, though the return port was 1/4". Using 1/4" hose, I connected it with a 1/4" to 5/16" adapter, which returned to the newly adapted hardline.~~

We're installing a new Holley 12-879 Fuel Pressure Regulator bypass that will resolve a bunch of my fueling issues.

Lastly, I reopened the return lines near the fuel tank return. Using the previously return lines, I connected this hose back to the fuel tank with 5/16" union barbs and secured the dangling hose with some good ol' zip ties.
