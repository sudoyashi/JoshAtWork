## You mean ANOTHER car??

Yes... unfortunately.

## All right, update time.

6 months since my last post, I just got my "new" 2007 Audi A3... but after a few months, things went downhill from there.

Knowing I needed to put some work into the Audi, it was reasonable for me to buy it because I have worked on cars enough to the point that I felt it was fine to do some of the repairs. While I was able to keep up for a bit, two project cars, long nights of diagnosis on weekdays, and trying to find parts online and in-person for my cars became more of a chore than a joy. 

I did not find myself enjoying my cars at all! I dreaded driving them for the fear of not being able to drive around. I did not want to continue trying to work with 2 project cars, where 1 of them was my daily, so I had to pivot and take a loss.

## Enter the Civic.
