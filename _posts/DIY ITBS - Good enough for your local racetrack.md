DIY ITBS - Good enough for your local racetrack

Introduction - Time is the DIY tax

Next to putting together and calibrating my Megasquirt, this is the second hardest part of rebuilding the cab, technically speaking. I don't have engineering and precision design in my background, so this has been a very difficult learning process. Hopefully, you'll waste less time reading this instead of deciding to make your own ITB setup like me. If I had the money, you bet I would buy everything. But we don't, so here we are. This has been months in the making, talking and getting opinions from my fabricator, webinars, and a lot of time spent drafting.  

From start to finish, the DIY ITB milestones

1. Choose - Picking a set of throttle bodies
2. Measure - Your first drawing
3. Fitment - Mounting the throttle bodies
4. Air - Create a trumpet and filter system
5. Attachments - Sensors, vacuum, and throttle cable
6. Final assembly

Choose - Picking a set of throttle bodies

Let's start with the throttle bodies, without them, we can't make a complete drawing. But where do you start?

There is an enormous amount of writing and videos on individual throttle bodies, but not a lot of them can summarize all the good info in a way that helps you decide. Given the issues with cost, application, and engine specificity, you really won't find too much info on your exact application. These are the resources I found that were most useful:

Measure - The critical drawing

The drawing is the core of the whole project, if you can't depend on your drawing, then you can't finish this project. It doesn't have to be a perfect drawing, but it has to capture the idea on paper to make it real.  Spend 5 minutes and draft what it's going to look. You'll miss some details, draw them in, make some arrows, and you've got most of the idea on paper. Then, let's take some dimensions.

On our Volkswagen ABA 2.0L, the intake manifold has four ports with slots for the injectors. I bought a spare intake manifold gasket to scan and draw over to take basic measurements. Writing all of this on scratch paper,  I've got most of my critical measurements: intake port size, inject port size, total width, total height, and mounting points. In the end, I couldn't design everything without some help on the fuel rail angle and injector ports.

I looked at everything and decided on outsourcing the final fabrication to Nub Autoworks Fabrication. He already had an ABA fuel rail setup but  since my flange was custom, I asked if we could make a project of it.

I sent over my sketches, dimensions, and we came up with a solution. He CNC'd the part and we finally have a mounting point for our fuel rail and throttle bodies.
