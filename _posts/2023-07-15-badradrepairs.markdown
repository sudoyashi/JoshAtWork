With obvious repairs needed, I might as well take this chance to upgrade some parts! The cooling system takes the highest priority and from there we can do some necessary changes to the fuel system and steering components. Some of these changes were long overdue, and this is the cab inadvertently telling me it needs my attention.

After a couple weeks of work installing new parts and refurbishing old ones, the cab is back up and running. Better than before, I'd say!

## Cooling system - New radiator, fans, and checking my electrical

Estimated time: 3 hours

*Radiator vs Heat exchanger: A radiator is a type of heat exchanger used to cool something. It's not only found in cars but has various applications. Heat exchangers can both cool or heat depending on their purpose. While engines need to be heated up to reach their optimal temperature, we usually don't pay much attention to the heating aspect in everyday cars, unless they are high-performance vehicles.*

### 12V, the reason why I overheated

I waited until I got a proper diagnosis to finish up this post, and it was a problem that I've had before. Saddened, but welp, we're really going to fix it now.

The radiator was the point of failure. Overheating was the cause. But what caused the overheating? My only fan should have kept it cool in the traffic temperature, so let's inspect the fan circuit and what do you know, my constant 12V power wire (red) was not powering anything! The entire circuit never closed and my fans never came on. I've remade a new 12AWG wire to supply constant 12V to the fan switch. I also replaced the fan switch to a lower rated one at ~165F to turn the fans on. Originally, I also had the 165 thermostat, but I didn't replace both at the same time. I guess I learned my lesson on that too.

Along with a new fan switch, I got an aluminum radiator, a new fan shroud, and two fans. In an A/C configuration, the dual fan setup would run separately, but because cooling for this car is paramount, for now I just wired them both at the same time. I might separate them later on if it's too much cooling. But you know what they say, temporary fixes are permanent. I did leave them as spade connectors so it wouldn't be too difficult to remake the circuit. The fans were wired in series to ground and switched power. With the shroud and the fan connected with M6 bolts and rivet nuts, all I had to do was mount it in the car

The size difference between the two radiators meant the mounting points to hold the radiator in place changed. I made some brackets out of scrap metal around my house to hold in place. The factory part is also known as a Radiator Top Retaining Bracket, or Radiator retaining bracket. They are fastened with M6 x 1.0 x 15mm bolts..

The new thermoswitch opens around 165F instead of 188F.
