## Brief Coolant Temperature Research



What happens when an engine overheats or runs too hot?

- Cylinder head warps
- Cylinder walls warp, causing a piston to seize
  - Piston bore clearance and rings
- Combustion cycle can be affected



Reliability with coolant temperature range

- Emissions
  - Slightly higher so that combustion is easier
- Combustion efficiency
  - Combustion charge temperature can be influenced
  - More prone to suffer from detonation



## Influence of materials

- Aluminum
- Cast iron
- Billet
- Alloy heads
  - Anneals around 350C
  - Softens around 280C-290C



Temperature range

- General
  - 80C-105C
  - 180-220F
- What do we want?
  - Street application
    - 80-90C ideal
    - 70C-100C
    - Not past 100C
  - Race application
    - NASCAR engines, 800-850HP
    - 9000 RPM engines
    - Coolant operating temperatures around 145C/290F
    - For aerodynamic, less airflow through a radiator element.



**Older vehicles**

82C, thermostat opens





Pros and Cons of higher temps

- Pros
  - Thermal efficiency
  - Emissions
- Cons
  - Susceptibility to knock



Coolant issues

- Bar to coolant temp pressure
- Coolant should NOT boil



Water as "coolant"

- Better with reducing heat transfer



Glycol based coolant

- Slippery liquid
- Reduced heat transferability
- Better corrosion resistance



Electronic water pumps

Cold versus Hot engines

- Cold engines
  - Overcooling
  - Excessive clearances
- Hot engines
