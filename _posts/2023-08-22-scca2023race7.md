## An attractive hunk of metal

Charming. The Cabby's strongest suit is its charm, a vintage time capsule of what the world was like in the 80s. This car is not a showpiece, it's a project car and it was meant to be driven. The Cabby is the culmination of all my trial and error for the past three years as my first project car. All of my mistakes and successes, with the history and quirky nature of what Volkswagen represented in the 80s: a lovable car with its faults and all. It wasn't the fastest, but you don't care, it's a Volkswagen.

Here we are, with my best attempt at what we can call a homebuilt racecar. A Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet MK1. At 2200 lbs, 90hp from the factory, carbureted ITBS, a header-back exhaust system, and a rusty, crusty bottom, it's as good as it's going to get. I hate this thing, but I love this thing. I have no immediate aspirations with this car to be a champion racecar, I just wanted to enjoy driving something to the beach. The best surprises in my life have never been planned, things happen and I simply oblige.

As far as its driving experience, it's deafening in here with the convertible top-up. It's not the exhaust that gets you, it's the pinging sound of shitty, 80s plastic vibrating to no end is what really kills you in here. I'm at a standstill at the stoplight of Haloa Dr and Salt Lake Boulevard. I reach for the shifter and push it left and up. A distinct, but faint, click tells me that I've locked into first gear. My feet are in position, holding the clutch in and foot at the ready on the gas pedal. The heat creeps up on you as you sit in a car with no AC and untinted windows. But as the light turns green, the entire car jolts with fear and excitement commensurate with my RPMs as I depress the gas pedal and proceed to roll off the clutch. The engine growls into a lovely metallic roar that tickles my primal sense of joy. At full throttle, you can't beat the sound of ITBS, the pains of sitting in traffic roll away and all that remains is a childish grin plastered onto my face.

## Race day

My face and body still hurt from racing this thing. The lack of bolstering made it a challenge to keep my body in place, so I had to hunker down and keep from flinging out the window. All the vibrations and extra heat from running the car hard also put my body in a less-than-ideal state.

It has been years of effort trying to put this thing together to be not only road-worthy but race-worthy. The leaks are gone. Steering, suspension, and driving issues have been resolved. The ITBS are almost dialed in. All of the nights staying up 'til 1 or 2 AM to put this piece of shit together finally paid off. This was never meant to be a racecar, it was a car made to be driven and appreciated for what it was. I don't have the funds to make this happen as fast as I want it to, and I most certainly would love to have the funds to make it faster with EFI, better suspension, and better tires, but there will always be something better.

After upping the suspension to 125MM of thread for the front suspension and about 100MM of thread for the rears, there have been no rubbing issues since. My tires are 185/55/R15 500TW Arroyo tires. VERY cheap tires and are very shitty for autocross. They were definitely screeching throughout the turns and couldn't get a proper grip on any of my runs. It's hard finding tires in this size, but I did see one set of Falken tires that I could run on this car in the future. 

The sound of ITBS and immediate throttle response make driving this car so much fun for a tiny car. With a bit more power and some scare factor, this could definitely compete in the middle of the pack with proper driving. The lightweight chassis and short wheelbase make it a perfect contender for mid-power, around 120-150HP would really make this car a lot scarier so I'm hoping for that with next year's revisions.

I'll always be chasing and chasing the next best thing if I can't be satisfied with what I have now. I'm overjoyed with the success of my first project car. I can say I've completed the project car cycle and accomplished what I set out to do. It's so easy to lose sight of our projects because life gets in the way. For most of us in autocross, this is not our full-time job. We're not competing for the sake of championships and world records, we're here because it's fun. Because it's just for fun, it's not mandatory for anyone, so progress and projects go unfinished because we don't need to.

For now, I'm satisfied with what the car can do. I know it's slow and I'm okay with it for now. For now, I can relish having a completed car. Thank you, Arvin, for the photos, now I know how dinky this car looks on a track LOL.

## What's next for the cabby?

An ABA/JH swap.

Okay, I know I said I was satisfied but I have this ABA sitting in my garage and I think it's time for a bit more power haha. I'll be taking a break from projects for now to focus on other things, but when I'm ready in late October, I'll go through the ABA and start rebuilding it for some cabby power :) This will be my first venture into engine internals so that means new tools, getting things machined from Ted's Automotive, and a lot more frustration and triumphs ahead. If all goes to plan, it'll stay working. Or, I get an MR2 huehuehue.

Happy camper for the day, but I think I'll be bringing back the Civic Si for the last race of the year!
