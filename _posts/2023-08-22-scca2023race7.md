## An attractive hunk of metal

Charming. The Cabby's strongest suit was its charm, a vintage time capsule of what the world was like in the 80s. This car is not a showpiece, it's a project car and it was meant to be driven. The Cabby is the culmination of all my trial and errors for the past three years as my first project car. All of my mistakes and successes, with the history and quirky nature of what Volkswagen represented in the 80s: a lovable car with its faults and all. It wasn't the fastest, but you don't care, it's a Volkswagen.

Here we are, with my best attempt at what we can call a homebuilt racecar. A Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet MK1. At 2200 lbs, 90hp from factory, carbureted ITBS, a header-back exhaust system, and a rusty, crusty bottom, it's as good as it's going to get. I have no immediate aspirations with this car to be a champion racecar, I just wanted to enjoy driving something to the beach. The best surprises in my life have never been planned, things happen and I simply oblige.

As far as its driving experience, it's deafening in here with the convertible top up. It's not the exhaust that gets you, it's the pinging sound of shitty, 80s plastic vibrating to no end is what really kills you in here. I'm at a standstill at the stoplight of Haloa Dr and Salt Lake boulevard. I reach for the shifter and push it left and up. A distinct, but faint, click tells me that I've locked into first gear. My feet are in position, holding the clutch in and foot at the ready on the gas pedal. The heat creeps up on you as you sit in a car with no AC and untinted windows. But as the light turns green, the entire car jolts with fear and excitement commensurate with my RPMs as I depress the gas pedal and proceed to roll off the clutch. The engine growls into a lovely metallic roar that tickles my primal sense of joy. At full throttle, you can't beat the sound of ITBS, the pains of sitting in traffic roll away and all that remains is a childish grin plastered onto my face.
