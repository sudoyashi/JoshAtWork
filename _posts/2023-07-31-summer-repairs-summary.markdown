With obvious repairs needed, I might as well take this chance to upgrade some parts! The cooling system takes the highest priority and from there we can do some necessary changes to the fuel system and steering components. Some of these changes were long overdue, and this is the cab inadvertently telling me it needs my attention.

After a couple weeks of work installing new parts and refurbishing old ones, the cab is back up and running. Better than before, I'd say!

## Cooling system - New radiator, fans, and checking my electrical

Estimated time: 3 hours

*Radiator vs Heat exchanger: A radiator is a type of heat exchanger used to cool something. It's not only found in cars but has various applications. Heat exchangers can both cool or heat depending on their purpose. While engines need to be heated up to reach their optimal temperature, we usually don't pay much attention to the heating aspect in everyday cars, unless they are high-performance vehicles.*

The radiator was the point of failure. Overheating was the cause. But what caused the overheating? My only fan should have kept it cool in the traffic temperature, so let's inspect the fan circuit. The thermoswitch was setup for --- temp, while my thermostat was set for --- temp. Unfortunately, this could have been the fatal error in my setup.

I had a hard time finding the correct thermoswitch for the fan so I had to settle on this other 3-pin setup in the meantime. Excuses are long gone and so is this cooling system, so I found a temperature-matching thermoswitch and I'll install that one.

Along with a new thermoswitch, I got an aluminum radiator, a new fan shroud, and two fans. In an A/C configuration, the dual fan setup would run separately, but because cooling for this car is paramount, I'm bridging the ground and power wires so that both fans run whenever it is cycled on or off. Plus, I don't have A/C! The fans were wired in series to ground and switched power. The shroud was fastened to the car and had to adapt the mounting points to hold the radiator in place.

Finally, I spliced in a new temperature switch connector so that the measly wires wouldn't be exposed anymore. Yeah, that was definitely living close to the edge with these wires, lol.

#### Cooling Summary

- Parts:
  - Replacement aluminum radiator
  - Coolant (may have extra)
  - Lower thermoswitch
- To do:
    - Inspect coolant hoses
    - Inspect

## Fuel system - Need an outie for my innie

Estimated time: 6-8 hours

You may be surprised to know that my fuel system doesn't have a return line. Why? Because I was lazy... and I also broke the return line's fitting LOL. Other than cleaning them up, I can also make adjustments to the actual carb setup. Since the car is down, I'll take the time to replace that and also make some adjustments to the fueling.

Here are some of the issues I'm tackling.

### Intermittent car pops from idle - not the good kind

When I blip the throttle from a stop, there is a backfire from the intake side. The cause is probably the excess dump of fuel on blip that the car surges and doesn't combust in the engine, so the only way is out the intake in this scenario. Usually, we'd expect it in the rear so I can spit flames! Sadly, not the case.

### Rich from 1/8th - 3/4 throttle

Jet adjustments should be made in parts, adjusting one system at a time to 
We can correct this with a needle jet adjustment. My last setup had my needle at position 3 with an added shim to make it slightly richer. I'll remove the shim. Speaking of throttle, my last throttle cable got burnt as well, the action of the cable was ruined, so I have to also replace it.

### Carburetor idle adjustment screws are not synced

To my surprise, my adjustment screws were all over the place! From carb 1 through 4, it went from 2, 2.5, 4.5, and then 3.75. They should all be the SAME. Not sure if I was making adjustments or if they got lost. In any case, I'll dial them back to 2.5 turns and add some blue loctite to keep them in place.

### Install a return line

![Return line in engine bay](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/cabby/badrad9.jpg)

I'll have to reopen the metal return line and make sure that it runs clean. To do this, I'll cut open the line from the engine bay and reopen the connections at the rear near the fuel tank. This shouldn't take more than an hour to do.

### Replace damaged parts

Lastly, since the coolant splashed EVERYWHERE it could in the engine bay, the air filter got damaged, vacuum lines, and other parts also got burnt. I'll replace what I can to prevent further issues.

### Fuel Summary

- Parts to buy:
  - Crankcase vent filter
  - Any applicable fittings
  - Throttle cable
- Adjust:
  - Needle jet clip to 3, no shim
  - Inspect fuel bowls
  - Inspect jets
  - Clean carburetor system
- Install:
  - Fuel filter
  - Fuel return line, engine bay
  - Fuel return line, rear
  - Throttle cable
  - Replacement hoses

## Steering - Almost 3 years overdue, but time to actually fix this thing

Estimated time: 2 hours

- Inspect rear sway bar mounts
- Inspect the front sway bar mount

### Brakes - Just the rears!

Estimated time: 1.5 hours

This is going to be the simplest of all the issues that I have, I just have to install these new parking brake cables. The ones on the car are probably the original cables. These cables aren't doing their job that well anymore, I have to yank that brake to its highest click setting in order to lock my car down, not ideal.

New cables will just need to be fed through the bottom, hooked up to the parking brake lever in the drum brake system, and then fastened down from the cabin to ensure proper tension.
