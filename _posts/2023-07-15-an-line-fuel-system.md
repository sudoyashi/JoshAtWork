My goal was to update the fuel system to take 6AN lines. This would help with more options for adding or selecting parts with AN compatibility. This is my poorly executed plan that I'm trying to finish before summer ends LOL.

## Why not PTFE?

Honestly, it was just too expensive and it was a lot harder to get the parts now. A lack of research, understanding, and laziness in the past could have solved this as well! I was aware of the advantages that PTFE has over rubber-lined AN hoses, and if I could do it over again 6 months ago, then I would go PTFE. It's the best of all worlds.

Polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE was made to resist the corrosiveness of fuels, including methanol and E85, if I ever decide to run that. 

If I can get AN line, it would be cheaper for me to learn on and in the future I'll be ready to use PTFE. It is the more expensive route than just going PTFE alone, but I'm looking at this like I'll be wasting money anyways in this hobby, haha.

This also meant if I'm going to get PTFE, I want to get the right PTFE hose. Good PTFE hose has:

- [Conductive-core](https://phenixindustries.com/conductive-vs-nonconductive-ptfe-hose-in-automotive-use/), prevent any static buildup that could be a fire hazard with fuel lines

- High-quality PTFE lining

- Proper PTFE fittings with all of the correct angles, no excess

  

Unfortunately, at the time of writing, [Hot Rod Fuel Hose](https://hotrodfuelhose.com/) was out of stock with a lot of items.



## Why not hardlines?

 I could have used hardlines and made brand new ones, but for future applications, I did want to know and understand the applications for AN systems. Given the flexibility of AN lines, well mild flexibility, versus hardlines, I figure that AN lines would give me the benefit of adjust my fuel system in the future. 



## Other changes to my fuel system

This also means I will finally be installing a return line than just the simpler fuel-in only. This will be accomplished by this cheap filter from WIX to give me a return, since the carbs themselves don't have a return port.



## The fuel system mockup

Here is the fuel system I have mocked up for the engine bay, using existing hardlines for the main inlet and outlet. A table helps to see the parts laid out.
