## Fuel system - Need an outie for my innie

Estimated time: 6-8 hours
![Cleaned fuel system parts](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/cabby/while-im-in-there/fuelsystem-2.jpg)
You may be surprised to know that my fuel system doesn't have a return line. Why? Because I was lazy... and I also broke the return line's fitting LOL. Other than cleaning them up, I can also make adjustments to the actual carb setup. Since the car is down, I'm making some adjustments to my fuel system.

### An overview of how I can catch on fire

![Fuel system diagram 2023](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/cabby/while-im-in-there/fuelsystem-3.jpg)

### Issue: Intermittent car pops on idle - not the good kind

When I blip the throttle from a stop, there is a backfire from the intake side. The cause is probably the excess dump of fuel on blip that the car surges and doesn't combust in the engine, so the only way is out the intake in this scenario. Usually, we'd expect it in the rear so I can spit flames! Sadly, not the case.

### Issue: Rich from 1/8th - 3/4 throttle

![Needle jet adjustment](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/cabby/while-im-in-there/fuelsystem-4.jpg)

Jet adjustments should be made in parts, adjusting one system at a time to keep your sanity when tuning. However, I was running rich for a while with these carbs from 1/8 - 3/4 throttle. We can correct this with a needle jet adjustment.

![New throttle cable](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/cabby/while-im-in-there/throttle-cable-1.jpg)

My last setup had my needle at position 3 plus a shim. I'll remove the shim to lower the needle jet. Speaking of throttle, the throttle cable got burnt in some spots of the cable, which caused issues with the cable action. This was an easy replacement and just got another motorocycle cable replacement kit. It comes with all the tiny parts to complete the cable. This includes the cable ends, cable length adjustments, and cable sheathe. The new cable took about 40 minutes to put together, scavenging some parts from the old throttle cable to hold down the cable from the factory positions. The smarter idea would be to make a line with exact routing to the throttle actuator, but I don't have time for that!

### Issue: My idle was screwing around

![Idle adjustment screws and notes](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/cabby/while-im-in-there/fuelsystem-5.jpg)

To my surprise, my idle adjustment screws were all over the place! From carb 1 through 4, it went from 2, 2.5, 4.5, and then 3.75. They should all be the SAME. Not sure if I was making adjustments or if they got lost. I set them back to 2.5 turns.

|        | Carb 1 | Carb 2 | Carb 3 | Carb 4 |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Before | 3.75   | 4.5    | 2.5    | 2      |
| After  | 2      | 2      | 2      | 2      |

Intended tune: slightly lean idle, closer to 15AFR than 14.7AFR. I'll inspect idle speed and vacuum to see how it likes it.

### No deadhead, I want to be alive! Installing a return line.

![Return line in engine bay with cutter](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/cabby/while-im-in-there/fuelsystem-6.jpg)

I opened up the metal return line with a [tiny metal hose cutter](https://www.homedepot.com/p/RIDGID-1-4-in-to-1-1-8-in-101-Close-Quarters-Copper-Aluminum-Brass-and-Plastic-Tubing-Cutter-Multi-Use-Tubing-Tool-40617/100075014), the Ridgid tool was the perfect tool for the job because it was in such a hard to reach place. Then I used a -6 AN adapter to 5/16" hardline with a -6 AN to 5/16" barb end fitting. 

I actually bought a whole $200 AN hose kit to redo my whole fuel system, but I decided to return it all in favor of keeping my system simple and cheap. It was just extra money for not that much more return. Carbureted applications don't run much fuel pressure. The added abrasion resistance from AN lines weren't necessarily needed. I'll buy the PTFE hose set if it comes to it. AN lines would be great for other applications, but not for my use case.

![Wix filter in-line to 1/4"](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/cabby/while-im-in-there/fuelsystem-7.jpg)
Anyways, the 5/16" barb will connect my return line to my new fuel filter, a [WIX 33040](https://www.amazon.com/WIX-Filters-Complete-Line-Filter/dp/B000C9UJAA). This routes extra fuel/vapors back to my fuel tank. This filter worked for my application because it had 5/16" inlet and outlet ports, though the return port was 1/4". Using 1/4" hose, I connected it with a 1/4" to 5/16" adapter, which returned to the newly adapted hardline.

Lastly, I reopened the return lines near the fuel tank return. Using another hardline adapter to 5/16", I connected this hose back to the fuel tank with 5/16" union barbs and secured the dangling hose with some good ol' zip ties.

### Replace the burnt stuff

![Coolant splashed on everything](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/cabby/badrad/damage3.jpg)
Since the coolant splashed EVERYWHERE it could in the engine bay, the air filter got damaged, vacuum lines, and other parts also got burnt. I'll replace what I can to prevent further issues.

## Other housekeeping items

## Steering - Almost 3 years overdue, should I do it?

Estimated time: 2 hours

- Install steering column rebuild kit

I... am not looking forward to this one because I haven't touched a steering column before LOL. So, this will be a problem for future Josh.


## Brakes - Just the parking brake!

![New parking brake cables](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/cabby/while-im-in-there/parking-brake1.jpg)
Estimated time: 1.5 hours

This is going to be the simplest of all the issues that I have, I just have to install these new parking brake cables. The ones on the car are probably the original cables. These cables aren't doing their job that well anymore, I have to yank that brake to its highest click setting in order to lock my car down, not ideal.

![Parking brake cable to drum](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/cabby/while-im-in-there/parking-brake2.jpg)

New cables will just need to be fed through the bottom, hooked up to the parking brake lever in the drum brake system, and then fastened down from the cabin to ensure proper tension. I'll probably have to make more adjustments after the cables stretch into its normal position.

## Fluids - Transmission and Cooling

![Transmission fluid draining]()
Estimated time: 3 hours or more (depends on bleeding)

### Transmission fluid

Estimated time: 1 hour

Draining and filling transmission fluid is pretty straightforward. [Here's a VWVortex guide](https://vwgolfmk1.org.uk/forum/index.php?page=topicview&id=how-to_2%2Fguide-changing-your_6). I'm replacing it with 75W-90 Valvoline gear oil.

Cabby info compiled a wealth of information on everything related to the cab. Check out their write-up on [Transmission and Clutch](https://www.cabby-info.com/transmission.htm) here. I use this site for all my references and I'm hoping that my own sudoyashi.com can be a wealth of custom information some day too!

### Water and coolant

Estimate time: 2+ hours

Filling coolant is straightforward... fill the car with coolant. I bought a bunch of distilled water to make sure it's as clean as possible before moving it through the new radiator. I'm using G12 coolant to fill the system once the system is as clean as it gets.. From the local VW dealership, it was about $25 per gallon jug.

## Electric

I want buy better connectors and crimpers

## Summary: Projects cars are never meant to be finished

I could have rushed this project to get it back up and running as soon as possible but life, finances, and choices get in the way when it's not your job. I'm taking my time trying to put together this car again and do it well. I'd kick myself again if I tried to hodge-podge a solution for some of the critical parts of this car, like the fuel system! I won't be regretting any of the issues I'm addressing here because they were long overdue. I got away with running away from maintenance issues for too long, one way or another the car was going to get fixed lol. 

I'm hoping to wrap this car up by the end of July so that I have a bit of time to enjoy it in August and September. Once the Fall and Winter months start to roll in, we're going for my very first performance mod--a new camshaft.
