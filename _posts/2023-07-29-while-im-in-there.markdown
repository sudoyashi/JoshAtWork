## Fuel system - Need an outie for my innie

Estimated time: 6-8 hours
![Cleaned fuel system parts](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/cabby/badrad6.jpg)
You may be surprised to know that my fuel system doesn't have a return line. Why? Because I was lazy... and I also broke the return line's fitting LOL. Other than cleaning them up, I can also make adjustments to the actual carb setup. Since the car is down, I'll take the time to replace that and also make some adjustments to the fueling.

Here are some of the issues I'm tackling.

### Intermittent car pops on idle - not the good kind

When I blip the throttle from a stop, there is a backfire from the intake side. The cause is probably the excess dump of fuel on blip that the car surges and doesn't combust in the engine, so the only way is out the intake in this scenario. Usually, we'd expect it in the rear so I can spit flames! Sadly, not the case.

### Rich from 1/8th - 3/4 throttle

Jet adjustments should be made in parts, adjusting one system at a time to keep your sanity when tuning. However, I was running rich for a while with these carbs from 1/8 - 3/4 throttle. We can correct this with a needle jet adjustment. 

My last setup had my needle at position 3 plus a shim. I'll remove the shim to lower the needle jet. Speaking of throttle, my last throttle cable got burnt as well, the action of the cable was ruined, so I have to also replace it. The new cable took about 40 minutes to put together, scavenging some parts from the old throttle cable to hold down the cable from the factory positions. The smarter idea would be to make a line with exact routing to the throttle actuator, but I don't have time for that!

### Carburetor idle adjustment screws were not synced

To my surprise, my adjustment screws were all over the place! From carb 1 through 4, it went from 2, 2.5, 4.5, and then 3.75. They should all be the SAME. Not sure if I was making adjustments or if they got lost. I set them back to 2.5 turns.

### Install a return line

![Return line in engine bay](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/cabby/badrad9.jpg)

I opened up the metal return line with a tiny metal hose cutter. Then I used a -6 AN adapter to 5/16" hardline with a -6 AN to 5/16" barb end fitting. I didn't want to buy the whole AN kit because it was just extra money for not that much more return. Carbureted applications don't run much fuel pressure. The added abrasion resistance from AN lines weren't necessarily needed. I'll buy the PTFE hose set if it comes to it.

The return line will be connected to the new fuel filter, a [WIX 33040](https://www.amazon.com/WIX-Filters-Complete-Line-Filter/dp/B000C9UJAA), which routes extra fuel/vapors back to my fuel tank. I chose this filter because it had 5/16" inlet and outlet ports, though the return port was 1/4". Using 1/4" hose, I connected it with a 1/4" to 5/16" adapter, which returned to the newly adapted hardline.

Lastly, I reopened the return lines near the fuel tank return. Using another hardline adapter to 5/16", I connected this hose back to the fuel tank with 5/16" union barbs and secured the dangling hose. 

### Replacing or repairing other burnt parts

Lastly, since the coolant splashed EVERYWHERE it could in the engine bay, the air filter got damaged, vacuum lines, and other parts also got burnt. I'll replace what I can to prevent further issues.

![New throttle cable]()
The throttle cable got burnt in some spots of the cable, which caused issues with the cable action. This was an easy replacement and just got another motorocycle cable replacement kit. It comes with all the tiny parts to complete the cable. This includes the cable ends, cable length adjustments, and cable sheathe.

## Steering - Almost 3 years overdue, but time to do the steering column rebuild

Estimated time: 2 hours

- Install steering column rebuild kit

## Brakes - Just the parking brake!

Estimated time: 1.5 hours

This is going to be the simplest of all the issues that I have, I just have to install these new parking brake cables. The ones on the car are probably the original cables. These cables aren't doing their job that well anymore, I have to yank that brake to its highest click setting in order to lock my car down, not ideal.

New cables will just need to be fed through the bottom, hooked up to the parking brake lever in the drum brake system, and then fastened down from the cabin to ensure proper tension. I'll probably have to make more adjustments after the cables stretch into its normal position.

## Fluids - Transmission and Cooling

Estimated time: 3 hours or more (depends on bleeding)

### Transmission fluid

Estimated time: 1 hour

Draining and filling transmission fluid is pretty straightforward. Just need to do it. [Here's a VWVortex guide](https://vwgolfmk1.org.uk/forum/index.php?page=topicview&id=how-to_2%2Fguide-changing-your_6). I'm replacing it with 75W-90 Valvoline gear oil.

Cabby info compiled a wealth of information on everything related to the cab. Check out their write-up on [Transmission and Clutch](https://www.cabby-info.com/transmission.htm) here. I use this site for all my references and I'm hoping that my own sudoyashi.com can be a wealth of custom information some day too!

### Water and coolant

Estimate time: 2+ hours

Filling coolant is straightforward... fill the car with coolant. I bought a bunch of distilled water to make sure it's as clean as possible before moving it through the new radiator. I'm using G12 coolant to fill the system once the system is as clean as it gets.. From the local VW dealership, it was about $25 per gallon jug.

## Summary: Projects cars are never meant to be finished

I could have rushed this project to get it back up and running as soon as possible but life, finances, and choices get in the way when it's not your job. I'm taking my time trying to put together this car again and do it well. I'd kick myself again if I tried to hodge-podge a solution for some of the critical parts of this car, like the fuel system! I won't be regretting any of the issues I'm addressing here because they were long overdue. I got away with running away from maintenance issues for too long, one way or another the car was going to get fixed lol. 

I'm hoping to wrap this car up by the end of July so that I have a bit of time to enjoy it in August and September. Once the Fall and Winter months start to roll in, we're going for my very first performance mod--a new camshaft.
