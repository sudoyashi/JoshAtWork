As I was driving my car one day, I noticed that my temps were going much higher than normal. My fan was not turning on and I wasn't sure why. Knowing that I already replaced the thermostat and replaced the coolant, I figured it must be something with my electrical system. And it definitely was.

## Diagnosis

### Wires are not cables

Let's clarify some words:
- Wire, a single conductor that is usually copper and insulated. Wires come in many sizes referred to gauges. 
- Cable, a group of conductors. Four wires twisted together makes a cable.
- Gauge, refers to the size of a wire. The smaller the number, the larger the wire. The larger the number, the smaller the wire. Example: Size 0 wire are usually used for cables connected directly to the battery. Size 16 wire can be used for sensors and other small applications. Size is dependent on the the amps needed to carry over a distance.
- Connector, end pieces that connectors a wire or cable to a component. A 3-wire hall sensor needs a 3-wire connector. There are MANY types of them from cheap to expensive. Cheap ones may not clamp the wires or cable good enough. Premium connectors usually come with tougher insulation and weatherproofing that won't degrade as easily.
- Crimp, a solderless cold connection that clamps the wires to other wires or connectors. Or both! Some might argue they are not as strong as soldering, but GOOD crimps can outlast soldered connections and easier. The caveat is that it must be done well and must use the right tools and parts to make a reliable crimp. Don't forget the heat shrink!

## Solution: Replace the wires and connectors

The original wires were so bad that I decided to just replace them outright. Now... I did not replace the ENTIRE wire running to the relay box because 

## Tips to optimize: Wire twisting and sheathing

Wire twisting, concentric wiring, twisted pairs, all of these suggest twisting multiple wires together for strength and flexibility.

Wires are physically used and abused and we depend on them to work almost 100% of the time. Thin or weak wires, breaks in a wire, or any other physical weakness in the wire is a prime example for bad craftmanship. While twisting cannot breaks or other issues, it can prevent them by joining them together to be a sum greater than its parts. It works because similar to making rope, braiding individual strands together will make them stronger. The overall cable  will stretch as a unit, and not just the single strand.

### Wire protection

At the minimum, anything that can cover your wires is already a step above most DIY wiring projects. Here are a few and where they stand:

X = good!
- = eh
blank = nah, not worth your time

| Material                      | Easy-to-use | Engine Bay | Cabin and Trunk | Undercarriage | Resistance to fluids |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
|1. Electric tape                 | X           |            | X               |               |                      |
|2. Tesa 51608, wire harness tape | -           | X          | X               | X             |                      |
|3. Split wire conduit            |             | X          |                 | X             | X                    |
|4. Split wire loom               |             | X          | X               | X             | -                    |

When in doubt, Tesa tape is the answer. It's like 80% of what you need.

1. Electric tape is your last resort as a means of a quick repair. But because of it's adhesive, it makes it a weak repair and it'll eventually melt out and make a sticky mess around the wires because it wasn't meant for the harsh car environment.

2. Tesa tape is the premium alternative to electric tape. It's flexible, easy-to-use, and can withstand a majority of applications. I still would not suggest putting it near anything that would make it susceptible to fluids or spills (near coolant or fuel) but in general it should be fine. 

3. Split wire conduit is very good at keeping dirt and grease out, but at the cost of space and flexibility. This is the bulkiest item out of the list and while there are different diameters out there, it is stiff and can only bend so much. Use it where heavy protection is necessary like the undercarriage.

4. Split wire loom is the premium alternative to the conduit, in my opinion. Honestly, they're pretty equal, but this one is more flexible! Since it's braided strands instead than plastic, it's easier to manipulate but because it's fabric, fluids could permeate the loom.  

What's the best way to do it? Combine them!

Tesa tape with the conduit will make for a very stiff loom where you need it, whereas tesa tape and the loom will give you flexibility. Don't forget concentric wiring within the loom and you'll have a great looking cable. Zip ties, and bits of electric tape can also be added into the mix for making wiring harnesses at your discretion but that's where my experience stops. There are more things to learn when making a harness, but for general wiring, this should be good enough.
