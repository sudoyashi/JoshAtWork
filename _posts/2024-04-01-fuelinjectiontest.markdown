Fuel pumps. They pump fuel, but there's some math involved in how much fuel, at what pressure, and the timing of said fuel. On factory CIS setups, there are two fuel pumps fitted onto this Golf MK1. But, I got rid of one and replaced it with this bike fuel pump.

Now that I'm going back to fuel injection from carburetors, I'm getting rid of this bike fuel pump and plan to use the in-tank pump alone. However, I cannot trust any online information to actually say how much fuel it puts out! According to many vortex posts, it is supposed to work as a direct swap, no changes needed. Let's verify.

Here is the back seat. The fuel tank cover and logically, the tank, is under here. Removing two screws for the back seat, we can toss it to the side.

## Testing the fuel output

We want to power on this fuel pump for about 30 sec, then cut the power and check how much fuel we got. According to our estimates from online, we should expect the pump to output 36-44GPH.

| Pump    | Part Number | Part Number 2 | GPH   | LPH  | GPM    | G/30sec | oz/30sec  |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----- | ---- | ------ | ------- | --------- |
| In-tank | BOSCH 69481 | 357906092C    | 36-44 |      | .6-.72 | .3-.36  | 38.4-46.1 |
| Goal    |             |               | 13    | 50   | .21    | .105    | 13.44     |
| Test    |             |               |       |      |        |         |           |

For the test, just run the feed line into a big enough can to catch the fuel, keep it contained! To keep the fuel pump running, put the horn relay into the slot where the fuel pump relay would go. This will keep the fuel pump running consistently. 

Start your 30 sec timer and power on the car for about 30 sec. Turn off the car and record the measurements. 

In my test, we got about __ ounces of fuel. Our goal was 13oz, so we are perfectly fine! The fuel pressure regulator will handle the excess fuel.

Done with testing, I can confirm that on this fuel pump, part number ##########, this produces oz.





We have three Phillips-head screws, remove them. Get a flathead screwdriver and gently tap the cover counter-clockwise to release the cover, just like a jar lid.

Carefully unplug and remove the return, the feed hose, and 3-pin connector. This powers the fuel pump.

Clean around the cover and put rags down for the gasoline. Lift up the pump and set it down. Cover the hole and now we can meander at the pump, but be clean about it.
