According to the online results, I got 3rd?! I swear I hit a cone on my last lap and got a +1 (2 second penalty), but I guess it wasn't factored into the final tally. On paper, I've gotten my first podium, but I don't want to celebrate until I get a definitive 1st place. In any case, it's Honda domination in the top 3!

## Racing is better with friends

I'm grateful that I made friends throughout this racing forray. Between the MR2 guys with Euler, Mike, and Josh (aka Spyderman), Matteo in his NB Miata, Paul, Christian, Bryce, and a handful more, racing amongst friends was absolutely a blast. A new face, Dustin, is planning to bring his Aristo to the next race and I can't wait to see that thing rip.

When I first came out to the races, it was very intimidating for me because I didn't know anyone, everyone had cool and fast cars, and I was extremely nervous to put my foot down on the track with the Civic. Fortunately, making friends with similar cars and eventually with more people who wanted to talk about their cars and stories wasn't so bad. You start mentioning what you're doing here and there, ask them some questions and you see what piques their interest. After each race, you start to get more and more familiar with the flow of the paddock and the people in it. Racing is an interesting environment, most of your talking is done with your driving, haha. When you get back to the paddock, there's always the "shoulda, coulda, wouldas" but what you do out on the track is an honest display of who you are and what you can do.

It's nerve-wracking to race, especially in the beginning, because everyone has their eyes on you. They see your mistakes and flaws front-and-center. You can't hide your shit driving and you will be a shit driver. But people want to see you improve, they want to see you get better and push harder because we're all chasing the same lofty goal that arbitrarily has no meaning to others, but can mean everything for us. 

## Is the cabby racing???

We're rolling in with the cab on SCCA Hawaii race #7!

I distinctly remember saying "I'm just going to restore it back to running condition and keep it that way." Well, 1 year later and here we are preparing it for SCCA, haha! How am I going to prepare the cab for racing?

1. Improve front suspension
2. Add an oil catch can
3. Inspect tires

### 1. Improving the front suspension

I need a tighter front end so that I don't go wishy-washy into a turn. Currently, the front left can rub on particular bumps and turns so I want to avoid that. This will become more important on off-camber/on-camber turns where the car might dip down just enough. This means I will be doing the following:

- Installing the upper strut brace
- Installing (attempting to...) front sway bar, the headers will need some persuasion to give some clearance
- Increase height on front coilovers

### 2. Install an oil catch can

My car will be a part of the Prepared and Modified categories, and in the 2023 SCCA Rules, it calls for the installation of an oil catch can. In our case, as a low-powered, naturally aspirated car, oil blowby won't be a big issue but we have to conform to the rules. I ordered the cheapest one that will work for me, lol. Installing a catch can is the rule because it would prevent any accidental spills from an enginer puking oil out of its atmospheric vent, this was probably made for forced induction engines where blowby and crankcase pressure is higher, therefore increasing the chance of oil drips on the track.

### 3. Inspect tires

Yeah... the tire sidewalls aren't the greatest. I'm just going to hope and see if they let me race LOL.
