## You mean ANOTHER car??

Yes... unfortunately.

## All right, update time.

6 months since my last post, I just got my "new" 2007 Audi A3... but after a few months, things went downhill from there.

Knowing I needed to put some work into the Audi, it was reasonable for me to buy it because I have worked on cars enough to the point that I felt it was fine to do some of the repairs. While I was able to keep up for a bit, two project cars, long nights of diagnosis on weekdays, and trying to find parts online and in-person for my cars became more of a chore than a joy. 

I did not find myself enjoying my cars at all. Work and searching on websites for parts throughout the day and going back home to install said part was a terrible cycle. I dreaded driving them because I didn't know if they were going to break or not. I did not want to continue trying to work with 2 project cars, where 1 of them was my daily, so I had to pivot and take a loss.

Evntually sold the Audi... but not before buying the replacement!

## Enter the Civic

On the hunt for another car, I was mildly excited but mostly mortified. I did not want to buy another dud, so I went with the dealership to find my next car. I figure I can dig myself a hole with a newer car OR dig myself a massive hole with another used car.

| Requirements       | Reason                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Reliable           | Duh.                                       |
| Not stupid.        | Ugly ass Nissan Juke and Subaru Baja. Nah. |
| Not terribly slow. | I want to feel nervous pressing the gas.   |
| Not an SUV         | I don't have kids.                         |
| Still hotboy-esque | I don't have kids, because I am the kid.   |



And where did we end up? After a decent amount of test driving and perfectly logical means to justify this car, I went with a 2019 Honda Civic Si Coupe in Crystal Black Pearl at 27,000 miles.
