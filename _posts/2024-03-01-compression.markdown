Inconsistent compression across the board. But why?

## Compression test tell a story

Tested on a warm January 15, 2024. At this point, no repairs or replacement were made to the engine. Gaskets, head bolts, and timing components as found.

### Control results 

| Cylinder | Dry  | Wet          |
| -------- | ---- | ------------ |
| 1        | 80   | Did not test |
| 2        | 140  | Did not test |
| 3        | 150  | Did not test |
| 4        | 190  | Did not test |

In the beginning, I saw the readings and thought maybe it's just a bad head gasket. At that time, I didn't do a compressed air test with the camshaft out, I was swamped with work at the time so this project was on a lower priority. I ordered a new MLS head gasket and timing components to replace and waited for them to do another test.

### New parts, same results

Tested on February 27, 2024 on a cold night. Again the engine was tested on the "bench". Outside of the car. This invalidates the hot compression test result we would normally want to see (109+ PSI), but I'm looking for consistency. And well, we got consistency.

- New timing belt
- New tensioner
- New head gasket

| Cylinder | Dry  | Wet                            |
| -------- | ---- | ------------------------------ |
| 1        | 80   | 130                            |
| 2        | 130  | 155                            |
| 3        | 150  | 160                            |
| 4        | 200  | Did not test, put too much oil |

The consistency was that the second test gave us the same compression numbers. The compression tests aren't looking good. I'm getting low compression on cylinder 1, average pressure for 2 and 3, and cylinder 4 is getting monster pressure. The difference between cylinders aren't promising either. It seems like cylinder 1's rings are worn. The engine could run, but not at full power. The caveat, again, is that the tests were done on a cold engine! Less sealing, not accounting for expansion from heat, so the tests are only an indicator until the machine shop pulls out the pistons to check on clearances there.

### Checking the seals without opening the block

While I would love to disassemble the block, I don't want to cause more issues from my mistakes installing or incorrect torquing. I spoke to the machine shop and they recommended I can try a "leak" test. Add some transmission oil to the cylinders and see how much leaks past the rings. In theory, it should kind of hold some fluid but if one piston holds less than the other, then we might need to do more work.

On March 6, 20204, I filled the cylinders with 75W-90 transmission oil, with the cylinders about halfway up the walls and left it covered for 24 hours.

## So, are you going to rebuild the engine?

Yes. My wallet will hate me, but my sanity will thank me.

I was see-sawing between rebuilding and not rebuilding, ultimately, I think the final decision will come when I speak to my engine builder. In Honolulu, the only places that I heard for engine building were Snyder's and Ted's Automotive. Since I've used Ted's before, I went to them.

After consulting and telling them about my goal and current engine health (OK valves, age of engine, possible piston ring issue) they suggested it would be about $1000 for a clean rebuild. About $400 for the block to re-ring, glaze, and hone the cylinders. About $600 to build the head with new HD (heavy-duty TT) springs, seals, and possibly decking the head. For $1000, not bad! I'm sure it will be a little more expensive, but we're in a good range!

For parts I'm going to let Ted's machine shop take care of the block components to see what I need or don't need. For the rest of the parts I'm getting:

- [Engine gasket set for ABA 2.0L with standard MLS gasket 1.65mm](https://techtonicstuning.com/product/complete-gasket-set-for-96-early99-mk3-crossflow-20-8v/)
- Replacement crankshaft bolt, just in case
- Freeze plugs

Piston rings, bearings, and other block components, I'll let the machine shop handle in case I need to get different components.

## 7500 redline Golf.

The goal for the Cabby is to finish this project and not catch on fire. It's in my best interest to give it the best chance I can and if it means I need to sacrifice 4-6 more months to get it, let's get it done.

A choppy idle, with decent high-rev power with the responsiveness of ITBS. The NA ITB nature is something that suits my driving as I like being able to get on and off the throttle at a moment's notice. My agressive and punchy style suited me a lot better driving in an NA Miata versus my Turbo Civic.

From the internet estimates from the Vortex, 7500RPM on a healthy engine should work fine. I HOPE. The choppy 276 TT cam will sacrifice some street drivability compared to the OEM cam, but I want to use it for at SCCA as the primary "race car" so I'm not racing the Civic, since it's my daily. This build isn't revolutionary nor will it break any YouTube algorithm, but it's mine and it'll be a fun car! We don't have many other official races out here in Hawaii and I'm not planning for street races, either. This car will lose. LOL.

The specs I am planning for are:

- Engine:
  - Rebuilt block, 96+ ABA
  - Rebuilt head, 96+ ABA with TT HD springs
- Engine upgrades:
  - 276 Techtonics Tuning Camshaft, light chop
  - 40mm ITBS from a 2005 CBR600RR, custom intake flange from Nub Autoworks
  - Megasquirt 2 ECU with new wiring harness with Deutsch 29-pin connector
  - Techtonics Tuning Header back exhaust
- Wheel and Suspension
  - KW V3 suspension
  - Diamond Racing 14" wheels, lightweight "steelies" or other lightweight 14"
  - 185/60/14 Toyo RE71R
- Targets:
  - 120HP? I have no idea on the Dyno and tune. Frankly, I could care less. The main point is highly responsive NA car, the cab is 2200lbs, I'm not too wired haha.

## For the legacy of a sick whip

I can't say I "love" the cab like others would with their dear cars. The car is disposable, but it'd be very hard to find a replacement for what it does so well. The color, the convertible, the stories, and the shitty-ness of it, it's enjoyable. It's a good ship and it's one that I want to finish the project. Call it a sense of pride and silliness. It might , but at least I'll have a fully built engine in it, because when I sell it, that's a lot easier to market than having one cylinder with low compression.

My family and friends know this is MY car. This car has become part of my identity and in some ways it's fine. What I can do and how I view the world can be expressed through my work in this car. The limit is up to my wallet and imagination. 3D printing parts and learning more about the historic Golf MK1, MK2, and MK3 influenced a lot of my choices on what I want to do with this car. It has a good vibe to it and in Hawaii, it's always a good time.
