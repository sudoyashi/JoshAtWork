Modding this car back to stock.

## Wait why, the whole point is to mod your car. What happened?

I'm not against modding cars at all! As long as it makes it better or improves the performance. Otherwise, it seems like an excessive amount of money to blow. Not a big fan of cosmetics, especially if the performance gains are negligible. Sure, I would love to gain 10 HP on my car any day, but at the cost of $500+? I'll spend that money on gas and driving.

## What's the modifications that you want to change?

The cosmetics. It makes me feel 19 and not in the good way.

I was not a fan of the bumper holes and rear gurney flap extension because I am 99% certain is has no major effect on my car's performance. It's aesthetically okay, but I'd rather go big wing and big diffuser than these little mods.

To get back to stock I would need to order the following parts:

- Part No.: 71510-TBJ-A00; Diffuser Assy., RR. Bumper
- Part No.: 71508-TBG-A00; Garnish, L. RR. Bumper Side
- Part No.: 71503-TBG-A00; Garnish, R. RR. Bumper Side

As parts, it comes out to about $200-300 on estimate... but $500+ for shipping! I'll have to order locally.

## Honda Windward, they've ruined me with great service

Wonderful guys out here. I appreciate my local Honda Windward.
