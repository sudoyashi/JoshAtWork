Everyone's car running in an SCCA event needs to have a race number and class identifier. But what if you don't know where to get one? This is a DIY guide to making your own car decals.

## SCCA Car Numbers and Decals

The main idea is that your car should be easy to identify from across the lot. It is easier to identify cars with high-contrast numbers and letters. Using small decals, weak contrast, or an embellished design will make it harder to read. Be proud of driving and show off your number, that's the rule! Here is an excerpt from the 2022 Solo rulebook on vehicle identification.

### Reference Section 3.7 Vehicle Identification from 2022 SCA National Solo Rules

> 
> A. All vehicles must display numbers and class letters on both sides, which must be readable by Timing & Scoring, Course, and Grid workers at all times. 
>
> B. Only one set of numbers and class letters may be visible while the vehicle is running. 
>
> C. Class shall be represented by the upper-case abbreviated form rather than be spelled out. Ladies’ classes shall be indicated by the letter “L” following the class letters. (Example: “BSPL” instead of “B Street Prepared Ladies”). 
>
> D. Numbers and class letters should be positioned next to each other. All letters and numbers must be on body panels, not on windows. All numbers and class letters must use the same typeface and the same color, and this color must provide adequate contrast to the background color (see Appendix F for examples). 
>
> E. Numbers must be a minimum of 8” (20.5 cm) high with a 1¼” (3.25 cm) stroke. Class letters must be a minimum of 4” (10.25 cm) high with a ¾” (2 cm) stroke. In all cases, the height of the class letters must be between 25% and 75% of the height of the numbers. Stroke width must be at least 10% of the height (see Appendix F.) 
>
> F. The “1” on two-driver cars and the “L” on Ladies class cars are subject to all of the above requirements with regard to placement, color, size, and stroke

### TLDR; be a racecar. show your number and class.

## DIY race car numbers and letters

Ok, this is what you actually came for.
In my case, I used a Cricut die-cutting machine. It cuts a design based on the image files that it receives in .svg, .png, and more. It is a specialty machine that you probably won't casually have lying around. If you DON'T have one, you have a couple options:
1. Convince your girlfriend, boyfriend, or any significant other that they NEED a Cricut, where we come and swoop in to use it instead.
2. Cut it by hand with a razor
3. By it yourself (not recommended, we're on a budget remember!) 

Once you have a Cricut, let's look at the materials...

### Well, actually one material: magnetic vinyl

You can buy magnetic vinyl at home improvement stores, look for "magnetic vent covers". If they don't have that, look for magnetic vinyl sheets (<1mm thickness). At Home Depot, I picked up these **magnetic vent covers** at $8.99 each. Each pack came with three 8 in. x 15 in. sheets.

If your local stores don't have this material, you can also try Michael's craft store, Walmart, or Amazon.

In my case, I needed four car digits (44 x 2) and ten class letters (RK STH x 2). I used all 6 sheets with some scrap material to make a few more letters. As far as design, the simple answer is to **use a thick, bold, sans-serif font** (no curly things at the ends.)

### The longer answer, making the decal design

You can use any software to make the design for the Cricut, as long as you get an SVG file. If you have Adobe Illustrator, use it, since it can save as a .svg file, but I don't have a license anymore. Instead, I'll use Photoshop. In Adobe Photoshop, I used Arial and italicized the text. Set up your canvas to match your material, in this case, it was 8" x 15".

Create a text layer and type your number(s). For me, I just needed a single 4. Make your number as large as possible on your canvas to meet the 8" requirement. The number should run vertically so that the height can reach 8" or more. Rasterize your text layer and save, or export, it as a .PNG file. Finally, convert the PNG to an SVG converter using an online converter like (https://convertio.co/png-svg/). 

Save your .SVG and let's get cutting.

### Cut your design

With your SVG on your computer, let's load up the Cricut. (I'm also assuming you know how to operate a Cricut at this point, if not, please find a short tutorial elsewhere.)

1. Power on the Cricut and load your mat and cutting tool.
2. Open Cricut Design Space and upload your image (.svg)
3. On the computer, line up your design with your material on the mat
4. Load a sheet of PAPER to test the cut. Start the job and see where the design falls on an 8.5" x 11" and adjust your mat placement.
5. Remove the paper test and see if it fits within your vinyl material. If not, adjust your mat and make another cut. It's cheaper to make mistakes on paper than on our vinyl.
6. When ready, load your magnetic vinyl
7. Change your material to magnetic vinyl 0.6mm, it will not cut all the way, but that's okay. We can separate it after.
8. Cut your design
9. Remove the mat and remove the cut number or letter. Since it is not cut through all the way, use a razor and poke through the cuts. Once you release an edge or corner, you can peel away the remaining excess material.
10. Check your handiwork, doesn't look too bad!
11. Repeat as needed

### Alternative, cutting by hand

It sounds as dreadful as it is. 

Cutting by hand with a rule and razor is straightforward, use a stencil and cut out your characters. Without a stencil, curved figures such as 2, S, and C would be unnecessarily difficult. Print and cut out a stencil with thicker paper like cardstock. Better yet, if you have a wood or other hard material stencil, use that to trace and cut your numbers. A sharp blade and hard stencil will make this a lot easier.

## Conclusion

Make simple decals. Don't go artistic.

I needed race decals and figured I have the experience to do it myself. If you haven't used graphic design tools before, this can be daunting. Put in the time and watch a few tutorials on basic graphic design tools. 

If you don't have Adobe tools, use GIMP. It's a free alternative to Photoshop. Don't know how to use design tools? Watch some tutorials and in a few hours, you can certainly churn out something half-decent! Regardless of the circumstance, I believe that you'll find a way to DIY this in no time. Good luck!
