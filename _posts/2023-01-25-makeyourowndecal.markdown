This is going to be my first SCCA autocross event so I'm doing everything I can to be prepared for my first day. This post will look at the car identification rules and how I made mine for about $20 in materials.

## SCCA Car Numbers and Decals

> Reference Section 3.7 Vehicle Identification from 2022 SCA National Solo Rules
> A. All vehicles must display numbers and class letters on both sides, which must be readable by Timing & Scoring, Course, and Grid workers at all times. 
>
> B. Only one set of numbers and class letters may be visible while the vehicle is running. 
>
> C. Class shall be represented by the upper-case abbreviated form rather than be spelled out. Ladies’ classes shall be indicated by the letter “L” following the class letters. (Example: “BSPL” instead of “B Street Prepared Ladies”). 
>
> D. Numbers and class letters should be positioned next to each other. All letters and numbers must be on body panels, not on windows. All numbers and class letters must use the same typeface and the same color, and this color must provide adequate contrast to the background color (see Appendix F for examples). 
>
> E. Numbers must be a minimum of 8” (20.5 cm) high with a 1¼” (3.25 cm) stroke. Class letters must be a minimum of 4” (10.25 cm) high with a ¾” (2 cm) stroke. In all cases, the height of the class letters must be between 25% and 75% of the height of the numbers. Stroke width must be at least 10% of the height (see Appendix F.)

> F. The “1” on two-driver cars and the “L” on Ladies class cars are subject to all of the above requirements with regard to placement, color, size, and stroke

### TLDR - Visible letters and doesn't look stupid

The main idea is that the numbers and letters should be easily identifiable to know what number you have and what class you have. If you're using tiny numbers and letters, or if you have bad color contrast (e.g. white decals on a white car) trying to time and identify your car will just make it harder than it needs to be.

## How to make your numbers and letters

Ok, this is what you actually came for.

In my case, I used a Cricut die-cutting machine. It cuts a design based on the image files that it receives in .svg, .png, and more. It is a specialty machine that you probably won't casually have lying around. If you DON'T have one, you have a couple options:
1. Convince your girlfriend, boyfriend, or any significant other that they NEED a Cricut, and then you end up borrowing it
2. Cut it by hand with a razor
3. By it yourself (not recommended, we're on a budget remember!) 

Once you have a Cricut, let's look at the materials.

### Cheap magnetic vinyl

Well, one material. Magnetic vinyl is sold at home improvement stores and craft stores, though they may be marketed or sold differently. All you are looking for is cheap magnetic sheets that you can cut (preferably <1mm thickness).

At Home Depot, I picked up these magnetic vent covers at $8.99 each. Each pack came with three 8 in. x 15 in. sheets.

If your local stores don't have this material, you can also try Michael's and WalMart to find the vinyl. Otherwise, go to Amazon.

For four car digits (44 x 2) and ten class letters (RK STH x 2), I used two packs and the remaining material were scraps, leftover from the cuts. 

### Create your design as an SVG file

In Adobe Photoshop, I made the designs using an italic sans serif font, Arial. 

Setup your canvas to match your material, in this case it was 8" x 15". Color profile RGB (doesn't really matter honestly) and 72 PPI.

Create a text layer and type your number(s). For me, I just needed a single 4. Make your number as large as possible on your canvas to meet the 8" requirement. The number should run vertical so that the height can reach 8" or more. Rasterize your text layer and save it, or export, as a .png.

*Preferably, you would do this in Illustrator since it can save as .svg natively, but I don't have it!*

We have the .png file, but now we need an .svg for the Cricut to read. Go online and search for any PNG to SVG converter. Use that and proceed to cutting your design.

### Cut your design

1. With your Cricut plugged in, connect your computer to the Cricut. Load your mat and cutting tool.
2. Open Cricut Design Space and upload your image (.svg)
3. On the computer, line up your design with your material on the mat
4. Test the cut with PAPER first. See where the design falls on an 8.5" x 11" and adjust your mat placement.
5. Confirm the PAPER test with your vinyl material and see if it will all be on there. Make it look good. We're being cheap and can't afford screw-ups.
6. Load your magnetic vinyl
7. Change your material to magnetic vinyl 0.6mm, it will not cut all the way, but that's okay. We can separate it after.
8. Cut your design
9. Remove the mat and carefully remove the number or letter. Since it is not cut through all the way, use a razor and gently poke through the cuts. Once a corner or edge is released, you can carefully peel away the material.
10. Check your handiwork, doesn't look too bad!
11. Repeat as needed

### Alternative, cutting by hand

It sounds as dreadful as it is. 

Cutting by hand with a rule and razor is pretty straightforward but it gets VERY tedious around curves (such as 2, S, and C). To get around curves, you can make a stencil or be very patient cutting them by hand. I have done cuts by hand before but I don't miss them.

To get a decent cut, print and cut out a stencil with a thicker stock of paper. Better yet, if you have a wood or other hard material stencil, use that to trace and cut your numbers. A sharp blade and hard stencil will make this a lot easier.

## Conclusion

Making your own decals doesn't have to be hard. 

When you're in the position that you need something, you're going to get it done. Whether you did get a Cricut or have a razor and lots of patience, you can get it done. I needed race decals and figured I have the experience to do it myself. Most people probably won't have a background in graphic design, printing, and technical skill, but you can always learn.

Most people are miraculously capable when it comes time to do so. Or maybe I believe in people too much, haha. Regardless of the circumstance, I believe that you'll find a way to DIY this in no time. Good luck!
