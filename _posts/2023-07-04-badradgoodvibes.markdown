## Friday, July 2, 2023 - An overwhelming weekend
Unfortunately, the cab faced its first road failure-- we blew the radiator.

<hr>

We were expecting a fun cruise with the boys, but things took a turn for the worse.

Modern cars use fuel injection (FI) systems, which deliver fuel precisely at the right time. However, our car had a carburetor system, which is less efficient and can be problematic. Carburetors approximate the fuel needed and often provide more fuel than necessary.

The beginning of the cruise was great. I invited my high school buddy, whom I hadn't seen in eight years, to join. We had a noise-reduction intercom, so we could easily talk without yelling over the wind. Top down, surrounded by sick cars and their roaring exhaust notes, it was an enjoyable experience. As night fell, the scene became livelier with people and lights as we drove through town.

However, our Cabby struggled to navigate the traffic in Waikiki. The combination of light rain, heavy foot traffic, police cars, and fire trucks made it challenging for our car. It started stalling due to vapor lock, a condition where excessive heat in the fuel system causes the fuel to vaporize. Running on fumes is harder for a car than running on gasoline!

To prevent the car from stalling completely, I kept pressing the gas pedal in neutral, using up extra fuel so that fresh fuel could be pushed through. This resulted in a lot of noise during the drive. After twenty minutes of bumper-to-bumper traffic, we finally cleared the congestion, but by then, the car was running hot. We made our way through the last few streets, thinking we were almost home, but decided to make a quick pit stop before continuing. Another MR2 ahead of us stopped for a bathroom break, and with rain pouring down, it seemed like a good time for us to do the same. I put the top up and followed the others once they returned.

Finally, out of traffic! Eager to get moving, I revved the engine one last time but it bogged again. I thought, "Well, I guess I gotta unflood again," but this time was different. The car really struggle to get up to speed, the car sputtered hard and stalled, but more importantly, it started to smoke. Nothing happened for a bit after the initial smoke. "Oh fuck!" That's all I was thinking.  Too much heat, pressure builds up, and if it's not relieved something has to give. The car got too hot and a proper burst of smoke and fluid came from underneath the hood. Our view was filled with smoke and at that moment, I froze. I tried to stay calm after the initial smoke but the car behind us started to honk at us, they yelled "The car's going to explode!" Confused and frantic we bolted. No one yells that just for fun and my carbs are a fireball just waiting to happen.

I yelled to my passenger, Yaron, "Fire extinguisher! Fire extinguisher!" as I rushed to open the hood. The smoke cleared away and I was frantically searching for any trace of a fire. Fortunately, no fire. I'm sure the pedestrian shouted that out of genuine concern, but there is a big difference between a coolant failure and a fire. If there was a fire, smoke would be grey and billowing out of the car almost immediately. My adrenaline cooled down, but that sinking feeling that the car might be totally gone didn't fade. It's gut-wrenching to see all my work go up in literal smoke, but once I collected my thoughts, I got my hopes back up and convinced myself that I can fix this, everything was going to be okay.

After the breakdown, I had the car towed back home with the help of a friendly driver named Loto. He admired the car and jokingly asked if it attracted the ladies. Definitely not, haha! I appreciated his kind words. Once I returned home, I decided to join the final destination meet with my other car, the Civic. I texted Mike, the organizer, and arrived at Zippy's Kaneohe.

I met a lot of cool people from the cruise when I followed up with them at Kaneohe Zippy's. I talked with a few guys at the lot, one was named Senna. He was driving a MK3 Supra that was actually on FaceBook marketplace not too long ago. We talked about that deal as I was also interested in it when I saw it online. He let me sit inside for a bit, clean checkered floor mats, a custom shift boot and knob, and a few other decorum to suit his style. Sick yeah!

I also finally got Fabian's contact! This was one of the guys I met up with at the last meetup. I remember meeting up with Jimmy, Zeke, and Fabian back on the first cruise and I was telling my friend, Janiene, that I should have got their contact. Cool cats to hang with but if destiny is a thing, we'll find them again. Sure enough he was there and also let me sit in his black MK5 Supra while I was trying to contain my excitement. My yearning for a Supra has not faded and I'm happy to have made friends with these guys. 

Now to just to convince them to let me drive it >:) 

Fabian added me on Instagram after hearing that the Volkswagen died. Originally, the whole MR2/Supra group thought the Volkswagen caught on fire! That was hilarious but I had to dispel that fallacy lol. The whole incident was rough but I'm thankful it was just the radiator and not anything else. A big thank you to the guys from the group that called in the VW being down, really good spirits and supportive.

With the immediate damage controlled, it's time to get to work. I refuse to give up and will keep moving forward. My priorities now include fixing the cooling system, re-evaluating the fuel system, particularly the inlet and outlet, and addressing the steering column repair. If everything goes smoothly, I should be able to complete the repairs in a couple weeks.

Refuse to give up!
