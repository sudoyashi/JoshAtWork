## Friday, July 2, 2023 - An overwhelming weekend
Unfortunately, the cab faced its first road failure-- we blew the radiator.

<hr>

The car was definitely overheating, by how much, I don't really know. All I know is that my impatience and neglect to fix the lesser, but still important, issues finally caught up to me. I'm frustrated and exhausted from this because it was supposed to be another good cruise with the boys. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.

Carburetors are inefficient at best and a fireball is waiting to happen at its worst. Modern cars use fuel injection (FI), delivering a precise amount of fuel at exactly the right time. Carburetors, on the other hand, approximate the fuel needed and generally provide more fuel than FI. 

The beginning of the cruise was great. I took my buddy from high school, whom I haven't seen in 8 years, and asked if he wanted to jump in on a car cruise. I also just got my noise-reduction intercome set to talk to my passenger without worrying about yelling at each other through the wind. Top down. A bunch of sick cars, top down, and exhaust notes screaming down Nimitz Highway, it was a good time. The nighttime scene started to ramp up with people and lights as we went through town. Making our way downtown past Ala Moana and then Waikiki, things were slowing down bit by bit.

The cab was having a hard time driving through the traffic in Waikiki. Light rain, lots of people, a stop police car here, and a fire truck there. These are probably the worst conditions for this car, lol. The car was turned off and on as a result of the vapor lock, where too much heat in the fuel system would vaporize the fuel, so this led to lots of stumbling from idle. To keep the car from dying, I have to keep pressing the gas pedal in neutral, this uses up extra fuel so that fresh fuel can get pushed through. After twenty minutes of bumper-to-bumper traffic, the traffic went away but my car was rightfully hot at this point. I made my way through the final few streets and it seemed like we were home free but we took a quick pit stop before moving forward. Another one of the MR2s stopped ahead of us to stop by the bathroom. Since the rain was coming down some more, it'd be a good time for me to stop as well. I put the top up and once the other guys came back to their car and I followed them.

Finally, out of traffic! Eager to get moving, I revved the engine one last time but bogged down. I thought, "Well, I guess I gotta unflood again," but this time was different. The car really struggle to get up to speed, the car sputtered hard and stalled, but more importantly, it started to smoke. Nothing happened for a bit after the initial smoke but not long after, a big vaporous sound came as a rush of white smoke came out of my hood. "Oh fuck!" That's all I was thinking. The car got too hot and something in the cooling system burst. Too much heat, pressure builds up, and if it's not relieved something has to give. I stayed calm after the initial smoke but the car behind us started to honk at us, they yelled "The car's going to explode!" Confused and frantic we bolted. No one yells that just for fun and my carbs are a fireball just waiting to happen.

I yelled to my passenger, Yaron, "fire extinguisher! Fire extinguisher!" as I rushed to open the hood. The smoke cleared away and I was frantically searching for any trace of a fire. Fortunately, no fire. I'm sure the pedestrian shouted that out of genuine concern, but there is a big difference between a coolant failure and a fire. If there was a fire, smoke would be grey and billowing out of the car almost immediately. My adrenaline cooled down, but that sinking feeling that the car might be totally gone didn't fade. It's gut-wrenching to see all my work go up in literal smoke, but once I collected my thoughts, I got my hopes back up and convinced myself that I can fix this, everything was going to be okay.

After the breakdown, I got the car towed back home with my driver Loto. Very nice guy and he admired the car and uncle was like "ho, brah you must get chicks with that car ah?" Definitiely not, haha., but I appreciated the kind words nonetheless. When I finally returned home, I contemplated my thoughts and because I have another car, I might as well pull back up to the meet with the Civic! So, I pulled up to the final destination at Zippy's Kaneohe.

I met a lot of cool people from the cruise when I followed up with them at Kaneohe Zippy's. I talked with a few guys at the lot, one was named Senna (?spelling) and he was this super chill dude. Thoughful, fair-skinned and soft-spoken, he knew his stuff. He was driving a MK3 Supra that was actually on FaceBook marketplace not too long ago. We talked about that deal as I was also interested in it when I saw it online. He talked about how he got the car and let me sit inside with him, for the first time in a MK3 Supra! Really, really good person. He also empathized with my overheating issue and how his fan wasn't working, so talking with him was good.

I finally got Fabian's contact! I remember meeting up with Jimmy, Zeke, and Fabian back on the first cruise and I was telling my friend, Janiene, that I should have got their contact! Cool cats to hang with but if destiny is a thing, we'll find them in the second half. He also let me sit in his black MK5 Supra and I was trying to contain my excitement. My yearning for a Supra has not faded and I'm happy to have made friends with these guys. Now to just to convince them to let me drive it >:) Fabian added me on Instagram after hearing that the Volkswagen died. Originally, the whole MR2/Supra group thought the Volkswagen caught on fire! That was hilarious but I had to dispel that fallacy lol. The whole incident was rough but I'm thankful it was just the radiator and not anything else. A big thank you to the guys from the group that called in the VW being down, really good spirits and supportive.

I wouldn't know what else to do if it did catch on fire, haha. A bunch of what-ifs, but with the damage controlled it's time to get to work. I refuse to give up and have to keep moving forward. Organizing my thoughts and priorities, the immediate fix is to take care of the cooling system. Once the cooling system is taken care of, let's re-evaluate our fuel system, particularly with our inlet and outlet. After the fuel system, we can work on the steering column repair. If everything goes smoothly, it should be done in about 2 weeks.

## Repairs and "while I'm in there!" Syndrome

With obvious repairs needed, I might as well take this chance to upgrade some parts! The cooling system takes the highest priority and from there we can do some necessary changes to the fuel system and steering components. Some of these changes were long overdue, and this is the cab inadvertently telling me it needs my attention.

### Cooling system - New radiator, fans, and checking my electrical

Estimated time: 3 hours

![New parts](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/cabby/badrad3.jpg)

*Note: the broader term for a radiator is a heat exchanger. Radiators are not exclusive to automotive terminology, but the primary purpose of a radiator is to cool something. Heat exchanges may cool or heat depending on the application. Our engines do need heating up to get to operating temperature, but because assuming that most cars today aren't performance-oriented, we don't really pay attention to the heating side... probably.*

The radiator was the point of failure. Overheating was the cause. But what caused the overheating? My only fan should have kept it cool in the traffic temperature, so let's inspect the fan circuit. The thermoswitch was setup for --- temp, while my thermostat was set for --- temp. Unfortunately, this could have been the fatal error in my setup.

I had a hard time finding the correct thermoswitch for the fan so I had to settle on this other 3-pin setup in the meantime. Excuses are long gone and so is this cooling system, so I found a temperature-matching thermoswitch and I'll install that one.

Along with a new thermoswitch, I got an aluminum radiator, a new fan shroud, and two fans. In an A/C configuration, the dual fan setup would run separately, but because cooling for this car is paramount, I'm bridging the ground and power wires so that both fans run whenever it is cycled on or off. The fans were wired in series to switche power and ground. The shroud was fastened to the car and had to adapt the mounting points to hold the radiator in place.

Finally, I spliced in a new temperature switch connector so that the measly wires wouldn't be exposed anymore. Yeah, that was definitely living close to the edge with these wires, lol.

### Fuel system - Need an outie for my innie

Estimated time: 6-8 hours
![Cleaned fuel system parts](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/cabby/badrad6.jpg)
You may be surprised to know that my fuel system doesn't have a return line. Why? Because I was lazy... and I also broke the return line's fitting LOL. Other than cleaning them up, I can also make adjustments to the actual carb setup. Since the car is down, I'll take the time to replace that and also make some adjustments to the fueling.

Here are some of the issues I'm tackling.

#### Intermittent car pops from idle

When I blip the throttle from a stop, there is a backfire from the intake side. The cause is probably the excess dump of fuel on blip that the car surges and doesn't combust in the engine, so the only way is out the intake in this scenario. Usually, we'd expect it in the rear so I can spit flames! Sadly, not the case.

#### Rich from 1/8th - 3/4 throttle

Jet adjustments should be made in parts, adjusting one system at a time to 
We can correct this with a needle jet adjustment. My last setup had my needle at position 3 with an added shim to make it slightly richer. I'll remove the shim. Speaking of throttle, my last throttle cable got burnt as well, the action of the cable was ruined, so I have to also replace it.

#### Carburetor idle adjustment screws are not synced

![Idle adjustment screws and notes](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/cabby/badrad8.jpg)

To my surprise, my adjustment screws were all over the place! From carb 1 through 4, it went from 2, 2.5, 4.5, and then 3.75. They should all be the SAME. Not sure if I was making adjustments or if they got lost. In any case, I'll dial them back to 2.5 turns and add some blue loctite to keep them in place.

#### Install a return line

![Return line in engine bay](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/cabby/badrad9.jpg)

I'll have to reopen the metal return line and make sure that it runs clean. To do this, I'll cut open the line from the engine bay and reopen the connections at the rear near the fuel tank. This shouldn't take more than an hour to do.

#### Replace damaged parts

![Damaged hoses and new hoses](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/cabby/badrad10.jpg)
Lastly, since the coolant splashed EVERYWHERE it could in the engine bay, the air filter got damaged, vacuum lines, and other parts also got burnt. I'll replace what I can to prevent further issues.

#### Fuel Summary

- Parts to buy:
  - Crankcase vent filter
  - Any applicable fittings
  - Throttle cable
- Adjust:
  - Needle jet clip to 3, no shim
  - Inspect fuel bowls
  - Inspect jets
  - Clean carburetor system
- Install:
  - Fuel filter
  - Fuel return line, engine bay
  - Fuel return line, rear
  - Throttle cable
  - Replacement hoses

### Steering - Almost 3 years overdue, but time to actually fix this thing

Estimated time: 2 hours

- Inspect rear sway bar mounts
- Inspect the front sway bar mount

### Brakes - Just the rears!

Estimated time: 1.5 hours

This is going to be the simplest of all the issues that I have, I just have to install these new parking brake cables. The ones on the car are probably the original cables. These cables aren't doing their job that well anymore, I have to yank that brake to its highest click setting in order to lock my car down, not ideal.

New cables will just need to be fed through the bottom, hooked up to the parking brake lever in the drum brake system, and then fastened down from the cabin to ensure proper tension.
