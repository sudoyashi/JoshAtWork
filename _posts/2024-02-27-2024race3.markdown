New year, new season. I learned I'm a little better than I thought, the Civic has new techniques, and now I really want a Miata.

## The Civic is a safe car, but it won't break records

I'm officially out of Rookies and moved out to Street Touring Hatch or STH, per 2024 rules. In my class are two local veterans, Gary and Paul, driving a Civic Hatch and Golf GTI. They are much  better drivers than I am, with cars that are in tune for Autocross. It has only been one year in SCCA and my car definitely is not tuned in like theirs. It's hard to not compare, but their times are far better than mines. But, I definitely have come a lot further than I thought and definitely can hold a candle on courses with long straights rather than hairpins and curves at this time. My tires aren't grippy enough for the turns, but the little turbo can make up about a second of time.

I can push the Civic all I want, but it's just a safe car. It's hard to push the envelope with this car because I'm not sure where to push it. I've been asking for advice from other drivers and in the end, seat time and tires are what will get you through the ranks.

## My favorite cars so far

My Volkswagen is a boxy little shitbox, so I'm pretty biased with what cars I've taken a liking to in the paddock. The BMW 3 series chassis has always been a favorite but other ones include the 944, Mini, and MR2 AW11.

## A new challenge, pushing the limit RWD for the first time

I've never driven a RWD car seriously on the road, barring work trucks and SUVs, and here I am pushing a little car in a format I've never driven before. It was a blast to drive.

I've made a friend this season with Michael and his NA 1.6 Miata and eventually allowed me to take his car for a drive during the fun runs. I was nervous about it because while I have learned about weight transfer and understanding the limits with RWD in a simulation, that will never replicate real-world conditions. I had 3 runs with the Miata and the first one was calm and collected. I got used to the car, shifter, and clutch feel and wasn't pushing too much yet. Jokingly, Michael came up to me afterwards to ask if I knew there was a pedal on the right. You know, the GAS pedal. 

In essence, I took it that I wasn't pushing the car hard enough, so this time I made sure to mash the gas as much as I could. Off the start and into the first turn, rip through first gear and head straight into the first hairpin. Coming out of the hairpin was a series of turns and after adding too much throttle, lots of sharp inputs, and overcorrections, the rear-end broke loose, and finally spun out. It was comical how it all happened, I was in a spin for the first time and instinctively clutched in and freed my hands on the wheel to let the car correct itself. I recovered fine and continued to tear the the course in cursive, breaking traction and almost hitting cones. And to my surprise, I was STILL faster than my times in the Civic! Maybe it was because I knew the track better, but there's denying that I was improving.

I'm in disbelief that all my time sim drifting and rally driving was finally put to use. Countersteering and correcting the wheel prior to breaking traction, modulating the gas on turns to balance grip and rotation, it was all coming back to me and it kind of worked! Still, this was only my first few laps with the techniques applied in real life, there is a lot more to learn. But it's good. My horizon to develop is a lot wider than with my Civic . The Civic is not bad, by any means, but I need to dial in a lot more to eek out a couple tenths here and there. It's a lot more effort for an disproportionate gain.  It's hard to gain time on all-seasons when it's not raining.
