New year, new season. I learned I'm a little better than I thought, the Civic has new techniques, and now I really want a Miata.

## The Civic is a safe car, but it won't break records

![Civic Si](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img//scca/race6/race4-scca.jpg)

I'm officially out of Rookies and moved out to Street Touring Hatch or STH, per 2024 rules. In my class are two local veterans, Gary and Paul, driving a Civic Hatch and Golf GTI. They are much  better drivers than I am, with cars that are in tune for Autocross. It has only been one year in SCCA and my car definitely is not tuned in like theirs. It's hard to not compare, but their times are far better than mines. But, I definitely have come a lot further than I thought and definitely can hold a candle on courses with long straights rather than hairpins and curves at this time. My tires aren't grippy enough for the turns, but the little turbo can make up about a second of time.

I can push the Civic all I want, but it's a safe car. It's hard to push the envelope with this car because I'm not sure where to push it, there aren't many stock Civic drivers, as all of the other guys have changed their wheels and added suspension parts. I would love to spend more money on the Civic, but it's still my daily and my main project "race car" is still in the Cabby. I've been asking for advice from other drivers and in the end, seat time and tires are what will get you through the ranks and it seems like I might have to lean into tires to push my times further. Or, maybe I just need to switch it up.

## A new challenge, pushing the limit RWD for the first time

![It's a MIATA](https://sudoyashi.com/assets/img/2024/sccarace2-1.jpg)

I've never driven a RWD car seriously on the road, barring work trucks and SUVs, and here I am pushing a little car in a format I've never driven before. It was a blast to drive.

I've made a friend this season with Michael and his NA 1.6 Miata and eventually allowed me to take his car for a drive during the fun runs. I was nervous about it because while I have learned about weight transfer and understanding the limits with RWD in a simulation, that will never replicate real-world conditions. I had 3 runs with the Miata and the first one was calm and collected. I got used to the car, shifter, and clutch feel and wasn't pushing too much yet. Jokingly, Michael came up to me afterwards to ask if I knew there was a pedal on the right. You know, the GAS pedal. 

In essence, I took it that I wasn't pushing the car hard enough, so this time I made sure to mash the gas as much as I could. Off the start and into the first turn, rip through first gear and head straight into the first hairpin. Coming out of the hairpin was a series of turns and after adding too much throttle, lots of sharp inputs, and overcorrections, the rear-end broke loose, and finally spun out. It was comical how it all happened, I was in a spin for the first time and instinctively clutched in and freed my hands on the wheel to let the car correct itself. I recovered fine and continued to tear the the course in cursive, breaking traction and almost hitting cones. And to my surprise, I was STILL faster than my times in the Civic! Maybe it was because I knew the track better, but there's denying that I was improving.

I'm in disbelief that all my time sim drifting and rally driving was finally put to use. Countersteering and correcting the wheel prior to breaking traction, modulating the gas on turns to balance grip and rotation, it was all coming back to me and it kind of worked! Still, this was only my first few laps with the techniques applied in real life, there is a lot more to learn. But it's good. My horizon to develop is a lot wider than with my Civic . The Civic is not bad, by any means, but I need to dial in a lot more to eek out a couple tenths here and there. It's a lot more effort for an disproportionate gain.  It's hard to gain time on all-seasons when it's not raining.

## My favorite cars so far

My Volkswagen is a boxy little shitbox, so I'm pretty biased with what cars I've taken a liking to in the paddock. The BMW 3 series chassis has always been a favorite but other ones include the 944, Mini, and MR2 AW11. Actually, a lot of the cars at SCCA are interesting cars, so it's always a good day to mentally go shopping around for cars that I want to drive one day.

## Are the any applications to racing on the road?

![Roads](https://sudoyashi.com/assets/img/2024/sccarace3/roads.jpg)

For driver education, absolutely. For racing on the road, not at all.

It's a different environment in the racing world. The environment is designed for aggressive, high-speed, and the possibility for injury. But the streets are the Wild West! You have a different expectation on the streets where literally anything and anyone can be on the road. There aren't stewards or staff to lookout for you, there's police and emergency vehicles that are looking out for the law. In some ways, it seems like the law has higher precedence for safety. The rules should be there to improve safety and most of the time it is. Stop lights and stop signs do well at making the streets a bit safer. But my issues lie with the dominance of SUVs on the street, limited tint rules on the road for sedans and compact cars, "safety" inspections, and headlights.

Why are laws and tax breaks skewed for larger and heavier vehicles? Why are sedans and compact cars limited to certain tint, while trucks and SUVs have little restriction? The spectrum of "safety inspections" defeats the point of having a safe car in some ways. It's an awkward system because other states may not have one. If the core goal is improving public safety, drive education and driver training should be reinforced. I would rather have a better driver than an improved safety system embedded in software technology. ABS, lane keep assist, and lane departure warnings are great. But at the end of the day, the driver must have the final decision on how to drive the car.

There is a lot of incentive to buy a larger car, so you don't have to deal with all of the bullshit that comes with driving a smaller car like blinding your mirrors. I'm all for driver education and will continue to support better drivers for as long as I can. With that, there's some exciting news about it coming soon, but I'll leave it until we're finished with the event! It's Tire Rack Street Survival.
