   - Add more water, fold in dry
   - Repeat until no more water
4. No more water, start kneading
   - Flour your hands and kneading surface
   - Knead by scooping and pressing with the palms of your hands

   - Knead only as needed to form the shapes
7. Final rise (40 minutes)
   - Spread cornmeal on a baking sheet
   - Place dough on the sheet

8. Start preheat at 40 minute final rise
   - Oven should be ready at a moment's notice
   - Poke dough, if indent stays, ok to put into oven

## Storage

For a few days: store your bread at room temperature, wrap in foil or plastic. Mostly airtight, preferred. If it's in a airtight container, optimal freshness BUT be mindful of moisture, that would spoil the bread.

Longer? Airtight preferred.

## Notes on baking bread

You can find decent success on your first few tries, but don't expect it to be bakery bangers off the start. There are LOTS of ways to modify, improve, and degrade your dough-making skills. This is a simple recipe to get you making bread. 

### Shitty dough
- Dough can be too wet and never rise to its optimum size, slow down adding water so you don't add too much
- Dough can be too dry and not create a cohesive dough ball, add water
- Not enough springiness, keep kneading
- Water too hot or too cold
- Bad yeast
- Not rising enough, knead more, more rising time
