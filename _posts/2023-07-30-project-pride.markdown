Don't sell yourself short on your project car.

Whether you did "everything" on your project car, or not, there is a lot of work that goes without notice. The systems that need to come together for a car are fairly straightforward, you have your suspension, powertrain, drivetrain, electronics, and creature comforts. But nothing is so simple when it comes to a project car.

Project cars are a logistical nightmare because there are so many options and paths to take when building something you want; because no one really knows what the end is going to look like! You're not only the project car owner, you're also the parts supplier, the parts manager, the engineer, the mechanic, the support team, the accounting team, and the customer service representative. You research and test out parts on your own time, not knowing if this will fit *exactly* the way you imagine it. Sometimes you order parts and they're damaged. Sometimes they aren't the exact part you need because you thought a 2016 base Civic part could fit in your 2018 Civic Sport model. You fight your way through bullshit forum posts, and Instagram or TikTok hacks, and compare your builds with what other people have.  You look at your bank account and see how much more meals to skip so you can afford the next part. You look at your build and aren't sure where you want to go. It's a complicated and a mega challenge when trying to imagine what your car is going to be. I don't believe we need to struggle when owning a project car, but I think it makes it all the sweeter.

Motivation is real, but so is your budget.

Project cars will never make you money. Cars, in general, will not make you money. They are money-sucking pits of darkness that will only take away as much as you can provide. Remember, this is all for the fun and excitement that cars give us access to. I often ask myself, "What's the point of building this car?" And the only acceptable answer to that is: because I enjoy it.

Barring racing teams and performance technicians, you will not earn that money and time back from working on project cars. It's 1 a.m. at your buddy's garage wondering why this 3-hour job took 10 hours to install some goddamn air suspension. You won't get that Saturday back, and as a bonus, your significant other got annoyed with you for wasting so much time. You drop a socket in the pits of the engine bay and take 15 minutes to get the stupid tool back. You watch tutorial after tutorial on how to remove a certain bracket which is supposed to be easy, but no one can clearly explain how to do it. Everyone on the forums seems to know everything and only points you at the Search Bar because they think you're too stupid to waste their time answering a question that has already been answered.

But occasionally, you remember what you went through, and it empowers you to know you can get through the bullshit times. All of the struggle, confusion, and frustration that comes from owning this car is worth it when you're driving your car through Waimanalo, through the twisting roads in Makapu'u, and back through Sandy Beach Park. It's always worth it if you can reach the end.

Project cars were never meant to be easy. Life can get in the way. Your finances. Your family. Everything is willling
