Whether you did "everything" on your project car or not, a lot of work goes without notice. The basics in car maintenance is straightforward, things like oil changes, brakes, and tires, but it can get complicated fast when it comes to a project car.

Project cars are a logistical nightmare because there are so many options and paths to take when building something you want; no one knows what the end will look like! You're not only the project car owner but also the parts supplier, the parts manager, the engineer, the mechanic, the support team, the accounting team, and the customer service representative. You research and test parts on your own time, wondering if this will fit *exactly* the way you imagine it. Sometimes you order details, and they're damaged. Sometimes they differ from the exact part you need because you thought a 2016 base Civic part could fit in your 2018 Civic Sport model. You fight through bullshit forum posts and Instagram or TikTok hacks and compare your builds with what other people have. You look at your bank account and see how much more meals you can skip to afford the next part. You look at your build and need to figure out where you want to go. It's a complicated and a mega challenge when trying to imagine your car's future. We don't need to struggle when owning a project car, but it makes it all the sweeter.

Motivation is real, but so is your budget.

They will never make you money. They are money-sucking pits that will only take away as much as you can provide. A project doesn't finish itself overnight, and remember; this is all for the fun and excitement that cars give us access to. I often ask myself, "What's the point of building this car?" And the only acceptable answer to that is: because I enjoy it.

Barring racing teams and performance technicians, you will not earn that money and time back from working on project cars. It's 1 a.m. at your buddy's garage wondering why this 3-hour job took 10 hours to install some goddamn air suspension. You won't get that Saturday back, and as a bonus, your significant other got annoyed with you for wasting so much time. You drop a socket in the pits of the engine bay and take 15 minutes to get the stupid tool back. You watch tutorial after tutorial on how to remove a certain bracket which is supposed to be easy, but no one can clearly explain how to do it. Everyone on the forums seems to know everything and only points you at the Search Bar because they think you're too stupid to waste their time answering a question that has already been answered.

But occasionally, you remember what you went through, and it empowers you to know you can get through the bullshit times. All of the struggle, confusion, and frustration from owning this car is worth it when you're driving through Waimanalo, the twisting roads in Makapu'u, and back through Sandy Beach Park. It's always worth it if you can reach the end. Life will get in the way. Financial priorities will change. But stick with the project. Do a little at a time and make decisions you won't regret. Some people might remember the abandoned project that you stopped working on 6 months down the line, but everyone remembers the one you finished, the one you put in the work, money, and time to put together. Through the ridiculousness of sourcing parts and getting everything just the way you want it to.

It's a cycle. Whenever you think you're finished with parts and maintenance, something else will take it away and make you start all over. Everyone's project car goes through a loss, a failure. But it's those that push forward beyond that loss and make a success of themselves that is someone I can respect. It may be your 3rd or 4th transmission. Maybe you blew your head gasket. Misfires. Exhaust leak. The list of problems can go on and on. But what are you going to do about it? How far will you take the project? Are you going to make it happen?

I am proud of myself. I am proud of my work. I worked day after day, after work from whatever job I could take in the last few years. I poured all my time and money into researching, reading, experimenting, and testing. I made dozens of plans that will never see the light of day. My notes are scribbled everywhere I could have put them. In my phone, on receipts, pieces of paper around the house. Wherever I could. I've taken naps from exhaustion underneath my car and in the driver's foot well. And I've driven this thing as hard as I can whenever that car was repaired. I did everything I believed I could do.

And you should be too.

I wasn't born with mechanical talent. No one in my family guided me on this. I had some help from friends but most of this was done through research on the forums, short conversations with strangers, and dozens of opinions of what I should do. You keep trying. You keep doing what you can do and you refuse to give up. Take in that pride and remember what you accomplished. They can take away your tools. They can take away your car. But they can't take away the work, skill, and knowledge you possess. Your fire and passion are all you have, but that is you alone for as long as you live.

It's stereotypical advice, but now and then, you'll need it when you're down. I know I do.

## Insiprations

The Driving 4 Answers channel (D4A) inspired my bike carburetor conversion Volkswagen Golf. Seeing the work that he put in, especially putting it together in the video was really helpful. But what's more, his video on refusing to give up on a project car is where I adopted that guiding principle. Beyond project cars, I think it's a good way to approach anything that you want to have or achieve.

Tyler Y., my childhood friend. Back in our college days, I would hear stories of Tyler dropping his transmission multiple times a week just to work on his 240SX at the time. He sold me on the Cup Noodle budget to get the parts the he wanted and seeing his hard work and dedication and taking me drifting for the first time was a milestone in my head and I feel like I've never told him that at all, haha. His work ethic was a total shift compared to other things that I did with him when he had his project car and I admired that a lot.

Ronald M. another childhood friend. Same era with Tyler, but with a different influence. He always had ideas, his strong suit was abosluetly in storytelling, creativity, and thoughtfulness. He always had a plan for something, even if it went wrong and never gave in to an idea. At least most times, haha. He owned two Mistubishi Lancer Evo 8s and he showed me what a faster car could do on the road. I won't forget the sheer terror of speeding after he took me for a drive. Alas, I didn't grow in the same way with them because I had different priorities back then. They don't own project cars now, but damn what a good time it would have been if I did have one.
