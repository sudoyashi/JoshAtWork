First SCCA Event - SCCA Hawaii Solo 2023

There is a lot to learn after doing something new for the very first time and what I always learned in any new venture is that you'll get humbled real quick.

You think that just because you watched all the videos and saw what mistakes other people make that you won't make the same mistake first time around. But I will! Experience matters and living vicariously through the eyes and videos of someone else does not equate to your personal experiences. Your true colors will reveal themselves and you'll really figure out what you're made of. 

Are you really as balls to the wall mad? Or a goddamn priss. Driving a motorcycle for the first time. Competing solo in the North Shore Swim Series. Volunteering in a foreign country. It's all the same adrenaline pumping sensation filled with fear and nervous excitement. And we'll go through this again on my first SCCA event!



## Why are you racing? 

Who doesn't want to drive like a racecar? I want to be a better driver and take my own win in motorsports.

There aren't many other ways to legally learn and drive at the limit other than the track, especially on O'ahu. I only got into racing recently since I started watching Formula 1 (F1) and World Rallycross (WRC) from 2020. Since then, I've appreciated the ability to drive with precision and speed; at the limit of grip. It's not enough for me to just see it, I want to experience it. I don't think you can truly appreciate anything until you have personally experienced something as impactful as performance and competition. In competition it will be pretty clear where you stand once the checkered flag comes down.

But racing isn't some existential skill that will save the world, it's a sport. It's not mandatory or even necessary for us too live, but for the same reason that we cheer and praise the people we see in the entertainment industry, so why do we race? Because it's fucking fun.
 

## Competing in the Street Touring Category

### Minimum Preparation

There was a lot more reading in car prep than I thought! Read the rules and regulations for you local region. For Hawaii region, this is what I did:

1. Read the rules and requirements for the Jan 29, 2022 race: https://www.motorsportreg.com/events/scca-hawaii-solo-race-1-01-29-2023-aloha-stadium-lower-halawa-lot-795398
   1. Prepare all event requirements (registration, confirm check-in times, proof of license)
   2. Pay for registration, $50 
   3. Car prep
      1. Make sure you can pass [tech inspection](https://dl.motorsportreg.com/bffc18f6-c10f-4697-a957-48bb4351c4b1/)
      2. Top off fluids
      3. Read the rules - [Solo Rule Book (2022 at time of writing)](https://cdn.connectsites.net/user_files/scca/downloads/000/060/877/2022_Solo_Rule_Bookv8.pdf?1661354272)
   4. Required equipment
      1. SCCA Approved Helmet
      2. Rulebook compliant driver numbers (no painters tape!)

You will be putting in a bunch of time to make sure you do all of these steps correct. Reading the rules, confirming my class for the first time, trying to find the correct helmet, and researching what other things are recommended is where you can spend as little or as much time as you need.

## Personal Preparation 

This might look over-the-top but I need to write it all down, for my own sake.

### Tool prep

- Portal tire inflator
- Chalk 
- Little mechanic tool bag
  - Brake fluid inspector
  - Tire pressure gauge
- Mechanic toolkit
  - Wrenches, socket wrenches, screwdrivers
  - Torque wrench
  - 4 Jack stands
  - Hydraulic jack
- Consumables
  - Mask, sanitization stuff
  - Nitrile gloves
  - Simple clean
  - Zip ties
  - Towels and rags
- Buckets
  - Trash bucket
  - Spare bucket to just hold stuff

### Car prep

- Wheels, tires, suspension
  - Wheels - Since mine are stock, no modifications or extra thought needed
  - Tires - Because mines were closing in on the tread wear-bars, I decided to put some new tires on. I went with BFG Comp-2 A/S (not Sport comps) for this year and hopefully they will serve well. 
  - Suspension, no extra play in joints, OK
- Brakes
  - Inspecting my brake fluid, it had about 2% water. Closing in on 3%, I am not changing my fluid until after race #1.
  - Brake fluid water tester tool: https://www.amazon.com/ITEQ-Liquid-Tester-Indicators-Calibrated/dp/B076SC377J  
- Engine, cooling
  - Top off oil 0W-20, OK
  - Check coolant and reservoir, OK
  - Check battery tie-down with covered positive terminal
- Interior
  - Remove ALL loose items in the cabin and trunk
  - Remove ALL floor mats 
- Fuel
  - Arrive with about half tank of premium 92 (weight savings)

### Driver prep

- **Required!** Helmet
- **Required!** Driver Number and Class Letters
  - (x2) 44 - Magnetic Vinyl Number 44 for 2023
  - (x2) STH - Magnetic Vinyl Honda Civic Si Sport Touring Hatchback, (STH) as rookie (RK). I used this site to figure out my class: [SCCA Classifier](https://www.scca-classifier.com/)
  - (x2) RK - Magnetic Vinyl, wasn't sure if I needed to put my driver class in? R for rookie, or RK. Also had a hard time finding that detail.
- Other driving equipment? Gloves? Head sock?
  - I wasn't really sure about these. How serious am I actually taking this lol? I bought these anyway because it was cheap, about $45 for the gloves and head sock. I have a few piercings so the sock helps with avoiding any accidental nicks. Driving gloves also helps with my sweaty hands.
- Food, nourishment, and non-driving items
- Sun hat and sunscreen
- Sunglasses
- Mental
- Umbrella
- Folding chair
- Plastic bags, never know when it'll rain?

### Equipment and data prep

- iPhone with suction cup mount
- TrackAddict App
- Camera for pictures around the pits

I don't have telemetry data logging for myself right now, but I might in the future if I decide to go for Hondata.


## Modifications to be Street Touring (STH) compliant

With an intake and some extra body cosmetics, I had to make sure my car was compliant to avoid any issues.

The car was modified before I got it and they weren't the best mods out there for the car, in my opinion. The coilovers, intake, and aftermarket aero cosmetics were cool, but I was doubtful they added a substantial amount of performance to be noticeable. In other words, cool but not really worth it unless I went full mod.  I changed out the coilovers early on when I got the car and put it back to stock because the original electronic adaptive damping was something I would rather have than the stiffer, static coilovers.

The aftermarket intake was the one thing I actually liked and kept it. Compliant with ST rules.

The aftermarket spoiler addition and bumper holes were not in my taste purely because I believe most "aero" mods probably ain't gonna do much except change the way it looks. While the spoiler may kick up the air and spoil the air with a sharper lip, I probably won't notice nor will we actually know its improvements because it lacks any testing or data. It also looks a bit ricey to me.

Lastly, the bumper holes. I have no idea what the intention is other than relieving the "air pressure" behind the bumper. It doesn't. It can't. You would most likely only notice this at top speed, and even then, performance gained would be negligible. A proper rear diffuser with strakes or flat floor might offer more benefits, but again, we're in a low speed application car. I'll have to cover these holes to be compliant. (Really hoping that the tech inspection goes fine)


### Conclusion

It will be a lot of fun! Ultimately, I want to take a win on time some day but it definitely won't be this coming Sunday. Right now, I have all the opportunity to learn how to drive better. I'll make the mistakes and bad moments now to mitigate the ones in the future. It was a lot to figure out on my own and don't think it's the best way to introduce new people to the sport. But if I stick with the SCCA long enough, maybe I will continue writing about it.
