I went back and forth with how I wanted to move forward with the velocity stacks, in the end, I ended up buying the OEM velocity stacks because they just work. Manufacturing my own stacks was proving to be a materials challenge than anything. I designed and printed out several designs for the stacks and flange. While they fit well, the reality was that ABS and PLA might not withstand for long underneath the hood for proper driving. Print times are long and the Creality I have is not setup to the tee, meaning the prints aren't 100% perfect. The design process was fun, but I think I'll revisit this project later.

## What went wrong with custom velocity stacks

Like I said, the issue that comes with custom stacks was printing them in 3D.
