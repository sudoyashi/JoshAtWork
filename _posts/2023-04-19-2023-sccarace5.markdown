I DIDN'T GET LAST. WHAT A NICE DAY.

## Results: 9th in Rookies

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't upset about my results but looking back, it's okay. I was kind of hungover and did not get the best amount of sleep LOL. It's all for fun and I'm not in the competitive zone, yet.

The field of cars varies from race to race in the Rookie SCCA lineup. Hellcat, Giulia, AMG GT, Focus RS, tuned and modified cars, the list goes on! Practically, any of us can win because the course mostly balances the power differential. It helps to have enough power that the driver can handle and I've come to that conclusion as each race goes on.

Bryce and Christian are fellow Civic Si owners and I've come to enjoy the platform as it is. With light modifications, the car is an excellent daily driver and a beginner-friendly racecar. The nice thing is that this car is competitive. It's not totally out of the running against other powerhouses like the Focus ST, GTI, and other similar cars in the class. I would think that it's always the car that isn't performing well enough when I score low, but it's the driver. They can drive their cars and I can drive mine.

These guys are running in Rookie class as well and they aren't people to sleep on. Bryce is an excellent driver within the class where he pulled a P1 last race weekend (race 4)! Whereas Christian and I are always battling for position from weekend to weekend. It's a good fight to be in!

## Rain, missing cones and over-slowing

After driving around the track with fun run laps, I figured out where I was slow. First, I SUCK AT RAIN DRIVING. This was the first race that we had a straight downpour on the track and it definitely made me drive slower haha. I hit a couple of cones here and there and realized I was over-slowing the car. But it took me a while to figure out what was going on! Reviewing the race footage from TrackAddict, that's when I figured out what was wrong.

I was frustrated with my first couple of laps during the timed session because I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. Then the rain came down. Then the grip came down. Frustration is up. You get the cycle.


## Driving Improvements 
- Better turn-in point on hairpins
- Closing the gap on cones, just barely clipping some!
- Did not get lost on course

## Driving Errors
- Hitting the SAME cone over and over and not noticing
- Over-slowing on corner entry, I should not go below 17MPH on the hairpin
- Understeer in the wet
- Too much speed on the straight with a chicane
- Too much brake, not enough speed management

## Logistical issues
- Some of my camera angles sucked. I want to get a second GoPro dedicated to my footwork OR
- Instead of a second camera, I can get a GPS module to track my progress better. Looking at an XGPS 160 for Track Addict
- Ride-alongs. I really want to ride-along with another driver to see/feel what other drivers are doing differently.


## Conclusion - Take a mental break and come back to racing later

SCCA is on break! For now, I'll take a mental break from racing and focus on other things. Logistically, race weekends aren't too packed but there's a lot on my mind beyond racing. Specifically, job searching, IT stuff, and skateboarding has taken up my priorities. A few exciting life updates are coming up too so I'm excited for that! Anyways, cheers to another race weekend.

We're still not first, but we'll get there!
