Time is absolutetly precious, remember it.

## The longest book I've ever read and the importance of dates and names

Shantaram, a 936 page book, was the longest book I've ever read.

September 2019. I had A LOT of time in Uganda to read this during my Peace Corps service and was recommended to me by a very good friend, Erika, during our time out in Uganda. I was not so keen about reading the book because I didn't think I could read something like that, haha. I'm not an avid reader and my circle of friends aren't readers either, so it never crossed my mind to read for fun. What turned me to reading was 1) out of sheer boredom and lack of internet  and 2) it was written beautifully.

I am a fan of good vocabulary, especially when it's used in the right place and the right time. I've gotten a lot better at choosing when to use silly words and haughty vernacular whenever I can because I think word choice is a much stronger identifier of intelligence and awareness than anything else. Wanting to use technical jargon in a non-techincal setting makes you seem arrogant. Using oversimplified words to explain something technical can make you seem ignorant. As the tale of Goldilocks goes, your word choice needs to be just right to fit the situation.

## AE86 4A-GE 20V ITBS

One of the recent OSIxHI meets, I was talking to another person about cars and was explaining how my car ran bike carburetors and comparing it to individual throttle bodies or ITBS. I remember saying the sentence "it's just like the AE86's 4A-GE ITBS system..." and the other person stopped me right there and said "I'm going to stop you right there, you are not talking to a car guy." LOL. 

That kind of moment took me back and I remembered only a few years ago, prior to April 2020, that I did not know anything about cars. At the time, a car meant it had 4 wheels and took me from A to B. I was not an enthusiast by any means. 

As soon as the other guy said that, I reeled myself in and spoke with less jargon, and only slowly introducing new things as I went along. He was very receptive of all the jargon, he still got lost, but for the most part the conversation went much smoother.

## Okay, we get it. You know stuff about cars. So what.

Your time, my time, and everyone else's time is just as important. Cut the bullshit and start doing something important to you.

Putting down dates, times, and everything that marks our time alive can tell us what we've been doing with our lives. It doesn't matter what we're doing, but I want people to just do things that are important to them. I try to plan out and make as much time as possible to do the things I want and with who I want because it's telling of what's important to you.
