## Change your fluids

A fresh oil change and brake flush will set the Civic back to a good benchmark for performance once we're out on the track.

I got my oil changed at Honda Windward since I still have a maintenance contract with them. Obviously I can change my own oil, but I have a feeling I might not keep this car forever. Cars with a proven maintenance record, especially for a sports car, is valuable and helps with selling the car later down the line. Having my maintenance done at the dealership is a no questions asked type of service, they can also give me a quick diagnostic of the car when I check it in.

I flushed my brakes on my own with the help of a vacuum bleeder, which pressurizes the reservoir and by opening the bleeder valves at each brake cylinder, I can effecitvely bleed the breaks of air on my own. Worth the time saved, but you can easily bleed your own brakes by yourself using a spare Gatorade bottle, a hose, and leftover brake fluid. By keeping the hose submerged in brake fluid and hooking up the other end to your bleeder valve, you can mitigate the chance of adding air to your brake system.

## Tire inspection - Could be better

These tires are about 8 months old now and they definitely don't have the same grip from the first few races. I'll probably switch to new tires in another year, or perhaps buy a new set of wheels and tires instead. This will be the first purchase for the car if we continue to have SCCA races.

## Changes from the first half of the season

None! I will not be making any setup changes other than tire pressure.
