## Race Prep

As always, I need to prepare the car for racing so I flushed the brakes, checked on the tires, and contemplated on my racing strategy. Well, not really the last part, but I did do general maintenance.

### OEM Honda Brake Fluid

A fresh brake flush will reset the Civic back to benchmark stats for performance. For this 2019 Honda Civic Si, I used two bottles of 12oz Genuine Honda Fluid 08798-9008 DOT 3 Brake Fluid, available at your local Honda dealership or somewhere similar. In the spirit of SCCA solo racing, we flushed it by ourselves.

Inittially, I had this trick vacuum bleeder tool ready to bleed breaks only to find out that I had the wrong hose ends to link the new adapter and my hand pump. We went back to the tried and true gatorade bottle.

To bleed brakes by yourself, just make sure that the hose is submerged in fluid at all times.

1. Connect the hose from your gatorade bottle to the bleed port. OK to have no fluid in the hose since we're just starting.
2. Open the bleeder valve
3. Pump your brakes slowly and continuously. A good 3-5 second push down to the floor, then return to the normal position
4. Check your brake fluid gatorade bottle and inspect the color
5. Check your brake reservoir and top up as needed
6. Repeat until the brakes come out golden shower yellow, or whatever color your brake fluid is.

By keeping the hose submerged in brake fluid and hooking up the other end to your bleeder valve, you can mitigate the chance of adding air to your brake system.

## Tires, could be better

These tires are about 8 months old now and they definitely don't have the same grip from the first few races. As much as I would love to buy new tires, we don't have the disposable income for that.

## Changes from the first half of the season

None! I will not be making any setup changes other than tire pressures

Tire pressures, top-left is the driver, front-left tire, LHD.

## My Race Results


## Racing is better with friends

## Is the cabby racing???

Let's make the dream happen!

I distinctly remember saying "I'm just going to restore it back to running condition and keep it that way." Well, 1 year later and here we are preparing it for SCCA, haha! How am I going to prepare the cab for racing?

- Refine the suspension under quick turns
- Adjust the jets richer
- Add an oil catch can

The suspension will be straightforward, increase the ride height by upping my coilovers. I might also install the upper strut brace and lower sway bar as needed, but the headers will need some persuasion to install that sway bar.

Coincidentally, my jets will need to go back +1 step richer, which I was already at prior to this breakdown fiasco lol. The fuel pressure regulator that is installed should, hopefully, mitigate my fueling issues with bog on acceleration. I was running between 5-6 PSI before, but the new FPR brought it back down to 3 PSI. I also noticed on road tests that my WOT (wide open throttle) was very lean, reaching 16.0 AFR or ~1.09 lambda. The goal is closer to 13.0, and with my current main jets that would be impossible. I would need to step up 1 or 2 more steps in the main jets (from 165 -> 170 or 175). Each step, if we're keeping all factors the same, should yield about 1 AFR point. Theoretically, a 175 would work, but I need to test that.

Lastly, the oil catch can is not my idea really, I need to abide by SCCA rules. My car is heavily modified, according to the rules, so I need to affix a catch can because my PCV (postivie crankcase ventilation) system is vented to the atmosphere by a filter. Installing a catch can is the rule because it would prevent any accidental spills from an enginer puking oil out of its atmospheric vent. In my low horsepower, NA engine, there's very little chance this is the case. But rules are rules.
