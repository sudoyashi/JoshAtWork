Before this, I kind of wanted an MR2. But after this meet, I really want an MR2.

## Role call AW11, SW20, ZZW30

- AW11 / Generation 1: 5
- SW20 / Generation 2: 12
- ZZW30, MR-S / Generation 3: 3

Yes, there was also an NB Miata, MATTEO. But I'm also just counting the MR2s haha.

## Josh, why were you even there. You don't even have an MR2.

Cause they're fucking cool.

Mike, currently running the MR2 group who formed the group a few years ago with Euler, invited me to come out to the meet since I knew a few of the guys from a previous meet and SCCA. Again, Mike was really generous to invite me out and tried to oblige by photographing. I mean, not like I have a car to bring up attendance lol. But it was good to meet some familiar faces! There was Matteo, Johnny, Jesse, Euler, and Mike. I met a few others there but I may have forgotten your names... but all around nice people.

## Why were you taking their pictures?

I mean shiiet, I like my car and I was always my car photographed. I figure other car guys would be the same!

Since I used to work in the photo lab developing film back in University and own way too many cameras for one person, I figure I might as well use what I got. Using my Polaroid 600 has been current go-to format because I don't have to develop and print anything, I can do it one step! I actually gave one to Johnny, who checked on me when my Volkswagen's radiator blew back in Waikiki. Polaroids are an easy way to give my appreciation, and also being an nice token to have around.

Polaroids don't last forever, the print won't last without further protection from dust and UV. But the dated and aging nature of the print is part of its charm. Normally, I'd hate to say that the film or vintage look is cool when it's less than perfect because you can definitely get good looking photos with most film cameras if you understand how to use it. But pedantics aside, while Poloaroid film is expensive at about $2.25 a shot, they are most certainly worth their weight.

Unfortantely, my beat-up digital camera didn't fare that well that day! It has a massive scratched area on it and I keep forgetting about it, sens the lens flare issues get worse when the sun is out. I managed to shoot around it for the most part, but I need to trade away this lens asap.

## Gallery

I didn't get to meet all the owners, but through the group's generosity, I got to know a few of them. I think showing face, in any group, is worth something because your time is everything. Hopefully the owners find their pictures someday.
