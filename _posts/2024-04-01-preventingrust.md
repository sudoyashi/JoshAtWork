Tip from a sailor for after next time you take your car to the salt flats.... at a marine store, buy a gallon bottle of liquid pine sap resin. It's goopy and you mix it with fresh water, just a few gobs to a bucket. We brush this on every surface after a sail. It will totally neutralize the salt from harming anything. We do everything from the painted sides, to the deck, and of course any brightwork. So next time, just do this mixture in a pressure washer and after you've done your first wash, soak it down with that mixture. - Lastly, the race engine builder part of my brain wants to tell you to use DE-IONIZED water for your cooling system, NOT distilled. Ppl get this wrong all the time. Distilled might lack the minerals, but by also being de-ionized you don't have to worry about dissimilar metal corrosion from electrolysis. Adding a zinc anode to your cooling system is smart too. Good luck! Before leaving for the flats I would spray the whole thing in ACF-50, you can buy it n a gallon on Amazon and apply it with a paint gun. Learning to Cerakote all of your small parts and fasteners will be transformational to your salt flat adventures üëç Silicone based greases and not petroleum based will better resist salt infiltration in your fittings.
