I've been meaning to do a valve adjustment to the cab but never felt confident enough in my ability to do it on my own. Reluctant to bring my little 8v anywhere, mostly to avoid the time and money lost from trying to find a good shop to do it, I'm finally going to do it on my own.

This is the work I'm doing to prepare the 8v head adjustments to improve the car. I should have done this a long time ago, but hindsight is 20-20 right?

Problems with my current 8V head

The current 8v head has the following issues:

- Noisy valvetrain
- Unknown maintenance on valvetrain for clearances, probably never LOL
- Leaky valve cover, assuming that the head's flatness is out



The benefits I'm hoping to get are:

The main benefits would be:

- It's good maintenance for the car
- Tighter tolerances, more efficient engine
- Less valve tappet noises
- Replacing almost 40 year old parts that were designed to be replaced
- Fix my constant valve cover leak without having to add a bunch of RTV 
- New camshaft!



Parts and costs

Everyone's favorite category on whether or not you should do something. Who cares about the benefits if it costs too much?

$537 isn't too hard to swallow, but it's never convenient to drop hundreds of dollars on the spot lol. I don't like to buy part by part either because I get disorganized very quickly if I'm not careful.



Checking the clearances on my engine head

This is on a 1.8 JH solid lifter head (5 bearing caps, 4 bearing caps would mean hydraulic). 

### Specifications

According to the Bentley manual

![Bentley manual valve clearances]()

And here it is in a cleaner table:

### Actual measurements

### Instructions

1. Bring the engine to TDCRemove the valve cover
2.
