## Introduction

I've been meaning to do a valve adjustment to the cab but never felt confident enough in my ability to do it on my own. Reluctant to bring my little 8v anywhere, mostly to avoid the time and money lost from trying to find a good shop to do it, I'm finally going to do it on my own.

This is the work I'm doing to prepare the 8v head adjustments to improve the car. I should have done this a long time ago, but hindsight is 20-20 right?

### Problems with my current 8V head

- Noisy valvetrain
- Unknown maintenance on valvetrain for clearances, probably never LOL
- Leaky valve cover, assuming that the head's flatness is out

### Benefits to my 8V head

- It's good maintenance for the car
- Tighter tolerances, more efficient engine
- Less valve tappet noises
- Replacing almost 40 year old parts that were designed to be replaced
- Fix my constant valve cover leak without having to add a bunch of RTV 
- New camshaft!

## New camshaft and other important parts

**Total potential damage: $537**

Everyone's favorite category on whether or not you should do something. Who cares about the benefits if it costs too much?

$537 isn't too hard to swallow, but it's never convenient to drop hundreds of dollars on the spot lol. I don't like to buy part by part either because I get disorganized very quickly if I'm not careful.

## Checking the clearances on my engine head

This is on a 1.8 JH solid lifter head (5 bearing caps, 4 bearing caps would mean hydraulic). Checking the clearances is a routine maintenance item at around 15,000 miles.

### Specifications

According to the Bentley manual

![Bentley manual valve clearances]()

And here it is in a cleaner table:

### Actual measurements

From left to right, I'm marking each valve from 1 through 8 where 1 is starts closest to the camshaft pulley and 8 ends at the opposite end of the pulley.

### Instructions

1. Bring the engine to TDCRemove the valve cover
2. 





## The Techtonics Tuning G-Grind Camshaft

While a new camshaft does not technically add major power on its own, a new camshaft would shift the powerband over between the RPM range. There are three factors that the camshaft will affect:
- duration; how long a valve will be open and close
- lift; how far a valve will open and close
- timing; the timing change the combustion cycle between the head and the block
-

The goal of the camshaft is to change the profile of combustion at different RPM ranges. Remember the camshaft will not necessarily add power but modulate it (we're excluding the power gains from duration as this will increase air intake). However, the camshaft in combination with other modifications to the head such as a port & polish and performance exhaust system will improve power as a whole.

In a simplified view, an engine can get more power with more air coming in and going out of the engine. This pushes the crankshaft faster and faster, ultimately moving our wheels.



### From simple to complex, picking a camshaft

Great! You want more power, but how do you choose? Firstly, what are your goals?

For pure racing, you can lean towards a more aggressive camshaft.

For street (racing), you might be in the middle between mellow and aggressive.

For street and commuter use, you might as well not get a new cam and buy new tires instead.

A mild cam can improve your performance, but compare it to the cost of other modifications that you can do. An adage that I've heard when building a car is to go from the outside in.

- Start with your suspension and aero, then work towards the engine as the final means of modifications
- Save for an exhaust system, improve your cooling systems, buy new wheels, tires, and suspension, and confirm you have a strong electrical system with proper grounds and wires. All of this can come long before even thinking about camshafts.

Did all of that already? Let's go into a study and talk about a camshaft for the cabby.
