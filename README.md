# Car notes for future Josh

Jekyll build for the website Link: https://www.sudoyashi.com

A collection of my project notes on cars, design, and other hobbies that I decided to spend a stupid amount of money and time into. Why? Future Josh will thank me later.

If there's something I want to do that's even remotely complicated, I need to have notes. The point of good notes is to be able to look back and remember what I did. I'm going between my phone, computer, Instagram, and other browsers that it's hard to refer back to the same note location, so the solution was to put it on the internet for everyone to see. This way, I can point myself, and eventually other people, to my previous work.
