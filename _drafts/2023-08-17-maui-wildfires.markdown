## Maui Wildfire Crisis

The Maui wildfires were devastating news. And it still is. None of this has stopped and the issues will remain for years to come.

There's so much more I want to do about the situation. I wish I had more money to give. I wish I could be there to be a part of the manpower in helping the community. This whole scenario is something that personally affects me because I spent so much time as a volunteer and know the limitations and benefits that come in dire situations like this.

But I can do what I can.

This is not a place for complacency but don't forget about yourself too. I may not be able to afford to donate more, but I can speak about it. I can write about it. I can share my thoughts with close friends and family. I can still contribute to the greater situation at hand. Not everyone has the privilege to volunteer their time and money towards the cause and that's the reality that many of us on O'ahu face. Don't make the situation worse, read and stay informed, and give and promote where you can. One of my racing friends, Leila, and her family were directly affected because her family and friends are from Maui and it hurts to see what she and her family are going through.

I'm glad that the world is supporting our efforts in Maui and we are getting a prime spotlight because we are Hawaii. But without too much "whataboutism", this circumstance would not be the same for Guam, American Samoa, Tahiti, and any other island community within the Polynesia, Melanesia, and Micronesia communities. Maui is relevant because it's a worldwide vacation destination. But Guam never got the same reaction when they were directly hit by a hurricane (Typhoon Mawar) back in May 2023. The circumstances are not the same. The notoriety was not the same. But my best friend that I cannot lose was there and it shocked me that very few people knew what was happening.

There are tragedies around the world and we will never know the extent of all of them. But we do what we can.

I'll continue to talk about it and think of other ways that I can contribute. I'll continue to read the news and stay informed about world events. The world won't stop because of a tragedy but we can't forget that there might be more to come. Hurricane season is still in effect and people are in disarray and panic.

Racing is still on my agenda and SCCA Hawaii allowed us to donate items in response to the crisis. The road to recovery takes more than just the money, clothes, and work to see it through, it needs commitment and I hope that everyone that puts their money where their mouth is continues to put their money where their mouth is.
