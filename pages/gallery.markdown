It has overheated. It has blown up. It has caught on fire. But I haven't let it go yet. Most people regret selling my first project car, so I'm holding onto this one just a little more. In Hawaii, the car scene is full of old-school Toyotas and Hondas, but I've settled on the earliest example of a water-cooled Volkswagen—the Volkswagen Golf MK1. I wouldn't say I like this thing, but I love this thing.
