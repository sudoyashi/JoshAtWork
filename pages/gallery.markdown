I studied abroad in Korea in 2016 and found it both foreign and familiar. A lot of things that I saw and felt felt like I was back home in Hawaiâ€™i. This is a series on familiarity abroad.

This is my first project car and since getting my own beginner socket and wrench set in 2020, until now, I have spent roughly $10,000 inclusive of the fees, maintenance costs, custom parts, and other useless things I shouldn't have bought. It's probably more, but I stopped counting at 5 figures for this hunk  of metal lol.
