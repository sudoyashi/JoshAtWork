## Terms

- **Plug**, the male end of a connector. It has terminals that will push into a receptacle
- **Receptacle,** the female end of a connector. It has terminals that will receive a plug
- **Connector**, end pieces that connect multiple wires/cables to a component. For example, a 3-wire hall sensor needs a 3-wire connector. There are MANY types of them, from cheap to expensive. Cheap ones have too much tolerance, making for a loose connection. Premium connectors are a better fit and can come with insulation and weatherproofing options that won't degrade quickly.
- **Wire**, a single conductor usually copper and insulated. Wires come in many sizes (gauges).
- **Cable**, a group of conductors. Four wires twisted together to make a cable.
- **Gauge**refers to the size of a wire. In America, we use the AWG standard for sizes. The smaller the number, the larger the wire. The larger the number, the smaller the wire. Example: Size 0 wires are usually used for cables connected directly to the battery. Size 16 wires can be used for sensors and other small applications. Size is dependent on the amps needed to carry over a distance.
- **Crimp**, a solderless cold connection that clamps the wires to other wires or connectors. Or both! Some might argue they are less secure than soldered joints, but GOOD crimps can outlast soldered connections, but you need to use the right tools and parts to make a reliable crimp. Remember to add heat shrink before you put the terminal on! Soldered joints, even proper ones, are subject to cracking over time.

## Stronger wires, concentric twisting

Wire twisting, concentric wiring, and twisted pairs. These terms are the same: it means twisting multiple wires together for strength and flexibility. [HPA has a video explaining it all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsgUhNH7F7k), where I learned it from.

Wires are physically used and abused; we depend on them to work almost 100% of the time. Twisting is a preventative measure to improve the durability of wires. It works similarly to making rope; braiding individual strands together will make them work together, evenly distributing tension between wires. The cable will stretch as a unit and not just a single strand. Doing it's as simple as twisting a few wires together. For more consistent twisting, put one end of the cables in a drill, hold the end down and spin away.

## Wire protection

Protecting your wires is a step above most DIY wiring projects. Here are a few material options and where they stand:

X = good!
- = is aight
blank = nah, not worth your time

| Material                                | Easy-to-use | Engine Bay | Cabin and Trunk | Undercarriage | Resistance to fluids |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| Electric tape                           | X           |            |                 |               |                      |
| Tesa 51036, high-temp wire harness tape | -           | X          | X               | X             |                      |
| Tesa 51068, wire harness tape           | -           |            | X               |               |                      |
| Split wire conduit                      |             | X          |                 | X             | X                    |
| Split wire loom                         |             | X          | X               | X             | -                    |

**When in doubt, Tesa tape is the answer.** It's that good.

1. Electric tape is your last resort for quick repair. However, electric tape is known for its weak adhesive. It can eventually melt out and make a sticky mess around the wires because it wasn't meant for the harsh car environment. In short, only use it if you have to.

2. [Tesa tape 51036](https://www.tesa.com/en-us/industry/tesa-supersleeve-51036-pv6.html) is the premium alternative to electric tape. It's flexible, easy to use, and can withstand most applications. Don't get it confused with the softer, fuzzy Tesa tape 51068. Use this tape inside the car and in other softer environments.

3. Split wire conduit is very good at keeping dirt and grease out but at the cost of space and flexibility. It looks like plastic gutter stuff. This is the bulkiest item on the list, and while there are different diameters, it is stiff and can only bend so much. Use it where heavy protection is necessary, like the undercarriage.

4. The split wire braided loom is the premium alternative to the conduit. Similar to the loom above, but this one is more flexible! It's easier to manipulate since it's braided strands instead of plastic tubing. Still, fluids could permeate the loom because of its fabric. 

What's the best way to do it? Combine them! But at what cost?

Tesa tape with the plastic loom will make for a very stiff loom where you need it, whereas Tesa tape and the braided loom will give you flexibility. Apply concentric wiring within the loom, and you'll have a great cable. Zip ties and bits of electric tape can also be added into the mix for making wiring harnesses at your discretion, but that's where my experience stops. There are more things to learn when making a harness, but this should be good enough for general wiring. All materials have pros and cons, so weigh your wallet and options, then make an adult decision and go for it.

## Volkswagen connectors, terminals, and other parts

Did you know there are different terminal sizes? Most spade terminals are 6.3mm (1/4") wide. The wires inside a relay may be the standard 6.3mm or the smaller 2.8mm (1/8") wide terminal. 

Buy wisely; buy pricey. Good terminals will last if done well.

| Terminal width (mm) | Terminal width (in) | Application |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| 2.8mm               | 1/8"                |             |
| 6.3mm               | 1/4"                |             |
