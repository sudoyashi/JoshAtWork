This is my first project car and since getting my own beginner socket and wrench set in 2020, until now, I have spent roughly $10,000 inclusive of the fees, maintenance costs, custom parts, and other useless things I shouldn't have bought. It's probably more, but I stopped counting at 5 figures for this hunk  of metal lol. 

I believe I started with about $300 in tools, basic hand tools for the normal project car enthusiast. Impact wrenches, specialty bits, suspension tools, more power tools, and so on. The list of stuff that was both useful and useless is too much to bother with. But overall, I don't  think $10,000 is a terrible amount for what I have. A decently working car that is absolutely unsafe and 100% worth the effort when it finally pulled through. 

Refuse to give up, and you shall be rewarded... probably. It worked for me.
