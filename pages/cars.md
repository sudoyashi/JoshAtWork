I own a [1985 Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet](https://www.sudoyashi.com/cars/#1985-volkswagen-golf-cabriolet) and a [2019 Honda Civic Si (10th gen)](https://www.sudoyashi.com/cars/#2019-honda-civic-si). I don't plan to build either of these fast, mostly for handling and decent fun. In the future, I'd like to build a Supra with speed in mind.

The Golf, coloquially known as the cabby, is the sketchy project car that hasn't caught on fire yet.

The Civic is my reliable and fun daily driver.
