I own a [1985 Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet](https://www.sudoyashi.com/cars/#1985-volkswagen-golf-cabriolet) and a [2019 Honda Civic Si (10th gen)](https://www.sudoyashi.com/cars/#2019-honda-civic-si). I don't plan to build either of these fast, mostly for handling and decent fun. In the future, I'd like to build a Supra with speed in mind.

The Golf, coloquially known as the cabby, is the sketchy project car that hasn't caught on fire yet.
