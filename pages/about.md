Hi, i'm josh!

These are my experiences with my projects and hobbies--but really it's mostly about cars LOL. I created this website to write about my hobbies because my posts tend to get too long for social media. Having everything in one place makes it easy to refer back to my projects and resources.

## So what does "sudoyashi" mean anyways?

A combination of my professional self and personal mentality.

**"sudo"**

I didn't really start learning about computers and machines until I got my first professional job in 2018. As the sole IT staff at an elementary school, I got familiar with the sudo command on MacOS machines. I learned that `sudo` was short for "superuser do," granting temporary admin permissions, and I happened to use that command a lot. As an added bonus, Sudowoodo is also my favorite pokemon.

**"-yashi"**

While studying abroad in Korea, I found it easier to go by "Joshi" due to language dynamics. I liked the sound of it. While improving my Korean, I encountered pronunciation challenges. This led me to the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), where the sound "yuh" is represented by the English letter j. So, "Joshi" became "yashi."

When trying to come up with a cool name that actually meant something to me, this is what I came with--sudoyashi. Refuse to give up.

I remember the times I was in Peace Corps where I was mentally and physically strained to my limits working with limited resources in Central Uganda. I remember the times working on my project cars, snapping rusty bolts, overheating, and literal fires. And I remember that I overcame those obstacles and came out better than I did before. I can't do everything I want, and often I find myself to know that I'm not naturally good at a lot of things, like sewing, but life is short. Whether the times are good or bad, you'll find a way to live through it, so let's make the most of it!
