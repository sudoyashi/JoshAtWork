## A place for my notes

I keep losing a lot of my notes and writeups for my personal projects, hopefully with this website I don't lose them as easily. This is mostly about my project car, the cabby, but I'll write about other things too. The MK1 community has A LOT of information, but it's scattered around through the Vortex. Hopefully, I can fill in the void with modern tech and documentation.
