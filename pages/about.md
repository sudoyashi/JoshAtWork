Hi, I'm Josh!

I keep losing a lot of my notes and writeups for my personal projects, hopefully with this website I don't lose them as easily. Mostly about my project car, the cabby, but I'll write about other things too. The MK1 community has A LOT of information, but it's scattered around through the Vortex. Hopefully, I can fill in the void with modern tech and documentation.

## So what does "sudoyashi" mean anyways?

It sounded cool when I used as my IGN in Monster Hunter.

**"sudo"**

I didn't really start learning about computers and machines until I got my first professional job in 2018. As the sole IT staff at an elementary school, I got familiar with the sudo command on MacOS machines. `sudo` is short for "superuser do," granting temporary admin permissions. As an added bonus, Sudowoodo is also my favorite pokemon.

**"-yashi"**

While studying abroad in Korea, I was called Joshi since it was easier to say. I liked the sound of it. In the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), the sound "yuh" is represented by the English letter j. So, "Joshi" became "yashi."
