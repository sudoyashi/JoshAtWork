Joshua P Domingo

Hey, I'm Josh! Professionally, I’m an IT administrator and I enjoy it enough in order to fund my non-professional array of hobbies like project cars.

This website is meant to house my projects and other side ventures I want to talk about that are too long to post on social media. I worked as a Peace Corps Volunteer for Uganda from 2019-2020 in business and agriculture. Alongside my fieldwork, I worked as a web designer because of my experience using WordPress, Jekyll, and web hosting administration. 

But other than cars, I haven’t gone totally crazy over the automotive world mostly because I don’t have enough money for that, there are other things I enjoy. Swimming, skating, and anything that I can DIY fills up the rest of my time.

Got a question? Let me know on social media!
