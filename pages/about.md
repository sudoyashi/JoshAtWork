Hi, i'm josh!

These are my experiences with my projects and hobbies--but really it's mostly about cars LOL. The website is meant for me to refer back to my projects and notes. The MK1 community has A LOT of information, but it's scattered around through the Vortex. Hopefully, I can fill in the void with modern tech and documentation.

## So what does "sudoyashi" mean anyways?

Uhh, I dunno. It sounded cool when I used as my IGN in Monster Hunter.

**"sudo"**

I didn't really start learning about computers and machines until I got my first professional job in 2018. As the sole IT staff at an elementary school, I got familiar with the sudo command on MacOS machines. `sudo` is short for "superuser do," granting temporary admin permissions. As an added bonus, Sudowoodo is also my favorite pokemon.

**"-yashi"**

While studying abroad in Korea, I was called Joshi since it was easier to say. I liked the sound of it. In the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), the sound "yuh" is represented by the English letter j. So, "Joshi" became "yashi."
