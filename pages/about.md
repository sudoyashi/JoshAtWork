## GO FAST AND RISK EVERYTHING.

Joshua P Domingo

Hey, I'm Josh! I'm an IT admin by day and a mild car enthusiast at night. 

This website is meant to house my projects and other side ventures I want to talk about that are too long to post on social media. I worked as a Peace Corps Volunteer for Uganda from 2019-2020 in business and agriculture. Alongside my fieldwork, I worked as a web designer because of my experience using WordPress, Jekyll, and web hosting administration. 

My background is all over the place. Working in arts and crafts since high school, gave me enough experience to continue using that throughout my years in college and career, making or modifying whatever I needed to suit my job at the time. 

I constantly draw from my experiences in carpentry, glassblowing, photography (analog and digital processing), web design, CAD, drawing, and bookbinding. With all of these skills.. I eventually got a job and started making decent money. Combined with the pandemic and an itch for a new hobby, this led to my most recent obsession with cars. 

I'm fascinated with technology new and old, so an 80s-project car with modern tech and an outrageous amount of material to learn about car maintenance, repair, and modification leads to what I'm doing today.

I'm not professional in any of my hobbies, so I am glad to learn or share about any project I've done. This is my 11th try at making my website and I think we're sticking with this one. I'll post my projects and whatever else I'm interested in.

Got a question? Let me know on social media!
