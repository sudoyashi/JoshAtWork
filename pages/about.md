Joshua P Domingo

Hey, I'm Josh! Professionally, Iâ€™m an IT administrator and I enjoy it enough in order to fund my non-professional hobbies like cars, crafts, sports, and cooking.

I made this website to write about my hobbies because they usually end up being too long to post on social media. Consolidating everything here will also make it easier to reference on my projects and reference materials. 

Other things about me: I worked as a Peace Corps Volunteer for Uganda from 2019-2020 in business and agriculture. I worked as a web designer because of my experience using WordPress, Jekyll, and web hosting administration. I also farmed for a hot minute while I was there, so it was pretty nice. Unfortunately, we got evacuated due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Besides cars, I like swimming, skating, and anything else I can afford to spend my money on. Hobbies aren't cheap.

Got a question? Let me know on social media!
